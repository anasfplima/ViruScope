TI  - Termini of all mRNA species of Marburg virus: sequence and secondary structure.
PG  - 376-80
AB  - The 3' and 5' ends of Marburg virus (MBG)-specific mRNA species have been 
      determined using reverse transcription-PCR, rapid amplification of cDNA ends, or 
      the reverse ligation-mediated PCR procedure after removal of cap structures with 
      tobacco acid pyrophosphatase. The polyadenylation sites of all MBG-specific mRNAs 
      were strictly conserved and corresponded to the predicted transcriptional stop 
      signals of genomic RNA. Determination of the 5' ends of the mRNA species showed 
      that mRNA synthesis started precisely at the first nucleotide of a highly 
      conserved transcriptional start site. The 5' ends of the mRNA species can build a 
      stable secondary structure with the conserved nucleotides always located in the 
      stem region of a hairpin. Nucleotide substitutions in the conserved 5' regions 
      are accompanied by compensatory mutations of the complementary nucleotide thus 
      leading to a conservation of the secondary structures. Compensatory mutations 
      were also found when 5' ends of mRNA of MBG strain Musoke were compared with MBG 
      strain Popp or the closely related Ebola virus, indicating that the secondary 
      structures will be conserved even if the sequence is altered.

TI  - Computational genomic analysis of hemorrhagic fever viruses. Viral selenoproteins 
      as a potential factor in pathogenesis.
PG  - 93-106
AB  - A number of distinct viruses are known as hemorrhagic fever viruses based on a 
      shared ability to induce hemorrhage by poorly understood mechanisms, typically 
      involving the formation of blood clots ("disseminated intravascular 
      coagulation"). It is well documented that selenium plays a significant role in 
      the regulation of blood clotting via its effects on the thromboxane/prostacyclin 
      ratio, and effects on the complement system. Selenium has an anticlotting effect, 
      whereas selenium deficiency has a proclotting or thrombotic effect. It is also 
      well documented that extreme dietary selenium deficiency, which is almost never 
      seen in humans, has been associated with hemorrhagic effects in animals. Thus, 
      the possibility that viral selenoprotein synthesis might contribute to 
      hemorrhagic symptoms merits further consideration. Computational genomic analysis 
      of certain hemorrhagic fever viruses reveals the presence of potential protein 
      coding regions (PPCRs) containing large numbers of in-frame UGA codons, 
      particularly in the -1 reading frame. In some cases, these clusterings of UGA 
      codons are very unlikely to have arisen by chance, suggesting that these UGAs may 
      have some function other than being a stop codon, such as encoding 
      selenocysteine. For this to be possible, a downstream selenocysteine insertion 
      element (SECIS) is required. Ebola Zaire, the most notorious hemorrhagic fever 
      virus, has a PCR with 17 UGA codons, and several potential SECIS elements can be 
      identified in the viral genome. One potential viral selenoprotein may contain up 
      to 16 selenium atoms per molecule. Biosynthesis of this protein could impose an 
      unprecedented selenium demand on the host, potentially, leading to severe lipid 
      peroxidation and cell membrane destruction, and contributing to hemorrhagic 
      symptoms. Alternatively, even in the absence of programmed selenoprotein 
      synthesis, it is possible that random slippage errors would lead to increased 
      encounters with UGA codons in overlapping reading frames, and thus potentially to 
      nonspecific depletion of SeC in the host.

TI  - Emergence of subtype Zaire Ebola virus in Gabon.
PG  - 139-44
AB  - Gabon has recently been struck three times by Ebola hemorrhagic fever. The first 
      isolate originating from the 1994 outbreak has been subjected to molecular 
      characterization of its GP and VP24 genes. Sequence analysis demonstrates that 
      the agent, Gabon-94 virus, belongs to subtype Zaire of Ebola virus. The isolate 
      is closely related to the Kikwit-95 isolate, and both viruses seem to have 
      evolved from a progenitor virus different from that of the Zaire-76 isolates. The 
      relatively close relationship of all subtype Zaire viruses isolated at different 
      geographical locations and up to 20 years apart suggests an extreme conservation 
      in the yet unknown natural reservoir of Ebola viruses. The level of genetic 
      variability in the human host might be different as indicated by the comparison 
      of isolates from a single outbreak (Mayinga-76 and Eckron-76), but needs further 
      investigation on clinical material of patients by PCR since both isolates have 
      different levels of passages in tissue culture.

      Democratic Republic of the Congo, 1995.
PG  - S170-6
AB  - Ebola virus persistence was examined in body fluids from 12 convalescent patients 
      by virus isolation and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 
      during the 1995 Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Kikwit, Democratic Republic 
      of the Congo. Virus RNA could be detected for up to 33 days in vaginal, rectal, 
      and conjunctival swabs of 1 patient and up to 101 days in the seminal fluid of 4 
      patients. Infectious virus was detected in 1 seminal fluid sample obtained 82 
      days after disease onset. Sequence analysis of an RT-PCR fragment of the most 
      variable region of the glycoprotein gene amplified from 9 patients revealed no 
      nucleotide changes. The patient samples were selected so that they would include 
      some from a suspected line of transmission with at least three human-to-human 
      passages, some from 5 survivors and 4 deceased patients, and 2 from patients who 
      provided multiple samples through convalescence. There was no evidence of 
      different virus variants cocirculating during the outbreak or of genetic 
      variation accumulating during human-to-human passage or during prolonged 
      persistence in individual patients.

PG  - 1193-201
AB  - The life cycle of the Ebola (EBO) virus remains enigmatic. We tested for EBO 
      virus in the organs of 242 small mammals captured during ecological studies in 
      the Central African Republic. EBO virus glycoprotein or polymerase gene sequences 
      were detected by reverse transcription PCR in RNA extracts of the organs of seven 
      animals and by PCR in DNA extract of one animal. Neither live virus nor virus 
      antigen was detected in any organ sample. Direct sequencing of amplicons 
      identified the virus as being of the Zaire/Gabon subtype. Virus-like 
      nucleocapsids were observed by electron microscopy in the cytoplasm of the spleen 
      cells of one animal. The animals belonged to two genera of rodents (Muridae; Mus 
      setulosus, Praomys sp1 and P. sp2) and one species of shrew (Soricidae; 
      Sylvisorex ollula). These preliminary results provide evidence that common 
      terrestrial small mammals living in peripheral forest areas have been in contact 
      with the EBO virus and demonstrate the persistence of EBO virus RNA and DNA in 
      the organs of the animals. Our findings should lead to better targeting of 
      research into the life cycle of the EBO virus.

TI  - Diagnosis of Ebola haemorrhagic fever by RT-PCR in an epidemic setting.
PG  - 463-7
AB  - This study reports the first field evaluation of a new diagnostic technique for 
      Ebola virus disease with sensitivity and specificity. Ebola virus causes rare but 
      fulminating outbreaks in Equatorial Africa. Rapid differentiation from other 
      infections is critical for timely implementation of public health measures. 
      Patients usually die before developing antibodies, necessitating rapid virus 
      detection. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was 
      developed, implemented and evaluated at Centre International de Recherches 
      Medicales de Franceville (CIRMF) in Gabon, to detect Ebola viral RNA in 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Twenty-six laboratory-confirmed 
      patients during and 5 after the acute phase of Ebola haemorrhagic fever, 15 
      healthy controls and 20 febrile patients not infected with Ebola virus were 
      studied. RT-PCR results were compared with ELISA antigen capture, and Ebola 
      specific IgM and IgG antibody detection. Ebola virus RNA was amplified from 26/26 
      specimens from the acute phase, 3/5 during recovery, 0/20 febrile patients and 
      1/15 negative controls. Sensitivity of RT-PCR in identifying acute infection and 
      early convalescence compared with antigen or IgM detection was 100% and 91% 
      respectively, and specificity compared with antigen detection and IgM assay 
      combined was 97%. Antigen capture detected only 83% of those identified by PCR, 
      and IgM only 67%. Ebola virus RNA was detected in all 13 fatalities, only 5 of 
      whom had IgM and none IgG. RT-PCR detected Ebola RNA in PBMC one to three weeks 
      after disappearance of symptoms when antigen was undetectable. RT-PCR was the 
      most sensitive method and able to detect virus from early acute disease 
      throughout early recovery.

TI  - Human asymptomatic Ebola infection and strong inflammatory response.
PG  - 2210-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ebola virus is one of the most virulent pathogens, killing a very 
      high proportion of patients within 5-7 days. Two outbreaks of fulminating 
      haemorrhagic fever occurred in northern Gabon in 1996, with a 70% case-fatality 
      rate. During both outbreaks we identified some individuals in direct contact with 
      sick patients who never developed symptoms. We aimed to determine whether these 
      individuals were indeed infected with Ebola virus, and how they maintained 
      asymptomatic status. METHODS: Blood was collected from 24 close contacts of 
      symptomatic patients. These asymptomatic individuals were sampled 2, 3, or 4 
      times during a 1-month period after the first exposure to symptomatic patients. 
      Serum samples were analysed for the presence of Ebola antigens, virus-specific 
      IgM and IgG (by ELISA and western blot), and different cytokines and chemokines. 
      RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and reverse 
      transcriptase-PCR assays were done to amplify RNA of Ebola virus. PCR products 
      were then sequenced. FINDINGS: 11 of 24 asymptomatic individuals developed both 
      IgM and IgG responses to Ebola antigens, indicating viral infection. Western-blot 
      analysis showed that IgG responses were directed to nucleoprotein and viral 
      protein of 40 kDa. The glycoprotein and viral protein of 24 kDa genes showed no 
      nucleotide differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. 
      Asymptomatic individuals had a strong inflammatory response characterised by high 
      circulating concentrations of cytokines and chemokines. INTERPRETATION: This 
      study showed that asymptomatic, replicative Ebola infection can and does occur in 
      human beings. The lack of genetic differences between symptomatic and 
      asymptomatic individuals suggest that asymptomatic Ebola infection did not result 
      from viral mutations. Elucidation of the factors related to the genesis of the 
      strong inflammatory response occurring early during the infectious process in 
      these asymptomatic individuals could increase our understanding of the disease.

TI  - Early immune responses accompanying human asymptomatic Ebola infections.
PG  - 453-60
AB  - In a recent study we identified certain asymptomatic individuals infected by 
      Ebola virus (EBOV) who mounted specific IgG and early and strong inflammatory 
      responses. Here, we further characterized the primary immune response to EBOV 
      during the course of asymptomatic infection in humans. Inflammatory responses 
      occurred in temporal association with anti-inflammatory phase composed by soluble 
      antagonist IL-1RA, circulating TNF receptors, IL-10 and cortisol. At the end of 
      the inflammatory process, mRNA expression of T-cell cytokines (IL-2 and IL-4) and 
      activation markers (CD28, CD40L and CTLA4) was up-regulated, strongly suggesting 
      T-cell activation. This T-cell activation was followed by EBOV-specific IgG 
      responses (mainly IgG3 ang IgG1), and by marked and sustained up-regulation of 
      IFN gamma, FasL and perforin mRNA expression, suggesting activation of cytotoxic 
      cells. The terminal down-regulation of these latter markers coincided with the 
      release of the apoptotic marker 41/7 NMP in blood and with the disappearance of 
      viral RNA from PBMC, suggesting that infected cells are eliminated by cytotoxic 
      mechanisms. Finally, RT-PCR analysis of TCR-V beta repertoire usage showed that 
      TCR-V beta 12 mRNA was never expressed during the infection. Taken together, 
      these findings improve our understanding about immune response during human 
      asymptomatic Ebola infection, and throw new light on protection against Ebola 
      virus.

PG  - 4125-30
AB  - The ability to rapidly recognize Ebola virus infections is critical to quickly 
      limit further spread of the disease. A rapid, sensitive, and specific laboratory 
      diagnostic test is needed to confirm outbreaks of Ebola virus infection and to 
      distinguish it from other diseases that can cause similar clinical symptoms. A 
      one-tube reverse transcription-PCR assay for the identification of Ebola virus 
      subtype Zaire (Ebola Zaire) and Ebola virus subtype Sudan (Ebola Sudan) was 
      developed and evaluated by using the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system. 
      This assay uses one common primer set and two differentially labeled fluorescent 
      probes to simultaneously detect and differentiate these two subtypes of Ebola 
      virus. The sensitivity of the primer set was comparable to that of previously 
      designed primer sets, as determined by limit-of-detection experiments. This assay 
      is unique in its ability to simultaneously detect and differentiate Ebola Zaire 
      and Ebola Sudan. In addition, this assay is compatible with emerging rapid 
      nucleic acid analysis platforms and therefore may prove to be a very useful 
      diagnostic tool for the control and management of future outbreaks.

TI  - Biological agents: weapons of warfare and bioterrorism.
PG  - 323-33
AB  - The use of microorganisms as agents of biological warfare is considered 
      inevitable for several reasons, including ease of production and dispersion, 
      delayed onset, ability to cause high rates of morbidity and mortality, and 
      difficulty in diagnosis. Biological agents that have been identified as posing 
      the greatest threat are variola major (smallpox), Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), 
      Yersinia pestis (plague), Clostridium botulinum toxin (botulism), Francisella 
      tularensis (tularaemia), filoviruses (Ebola hemorrrhagic fever and Marburg 
      hemorrhagic fever), and arenaviruses Lassa (Lassa fever) and Junin (Argentine 
      hemorrhagic fever). The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and 
      treatment of these agents are discussed. Rapid identification and diagnosis using 
      molecular diagnostic techniques such as PCR is an essential element in the 
      establishment of coordinated laboratory response systems and is the focus of 
      current research and development. Molecular techniques for detection and 
      identification of these organisms are reviewed.

TI  - Rapid detection and quantification of RNA of Ebola and Marburg viruses, Lassa 
      virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus, dengue 
      virus, and yellow fever virus by real-time reverse transcription-PCR.
PG  - 2323-30
AB  - Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are acute infections with high case fatality 
      rates. Important VHF agents are Ebola and Marburg viruses (MBGV/EBOV), Lassa 
      virus (LASV), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), Rift Valley fever 
      virus (RVFV), dengue virus (DENV), and yellow fever virus (YFV). VHFs are 
      clinically difficult to diagnose and to distinguish; a rapid and reliable 
      laboratory diagnosis is required in suspected cases. We have established six 
      one-step, real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays for these pathogens based on 
      the Superscript reverse transcriptase-Platinum Taq polymerase enzyme mixture. 
      Novel primers and/or 5'-nuclease detection probes were designed for RVFV, DENV, 
      YFV, and CCHFV by using the latest DNA database entries. PCR products were 
      detected in real time on a LightCycler instrument by using 5'-nuclease technology 
      (RVFV, DENV, and YFV) or SybrGreen dye intercalation (MBGV/EBOV, LASV, and 
      CCHFV). The inhibitory effect of SybrGreen on reverse transcription was overcome 
      by initial immobilization of the dye in the reaction capillaries. Universal 
      cycling conditions for SybrGreen and 5'-nuclease probe detection were 
      established. Thus, up to three assays could be performed in parallel, 
      facilitating rapid testing for several pathogens. All assays were thoroughly 
      optimized and validated in terms of analytical sensitivity by using in 
      vitro-transcribed RNA. The >or=95% detection limits as determined by probit 
      regression analysis ranged from 1,545 to 2,835 viral genome equivalents/ml of 
      serum (8.6 to 16 RNA copies per assay). The suitability of the assays was 
      exemplified by detection and quantification of viral RNA in serum samples of VHF 
      patients.

TI  - Rapid diagnosis of Ebola hemorrhagic fever by reverse transcription-PCR in an 
      outbreak setting and assessment of patient viral load as a predictor of outcome.
PG  - 4330-41
AB  - The largest outbreak on record of Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) occurred in 
      Uganda from August 2000 to January 2001. The outbreak was centered in the Gulu 
      district of northern Uganda, with secondary transmission to other districts. 
      After the initial diagnosis of Sudan ebolavirus by the National Institute for 
      Virology in Johannesburg, South Africa, a temporary diagnostic laboratory was 
      established within the Gulu district at St. Mary's Lacor Hospital. The laboratory 
      used antigen capture and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to diagnose Sudan 
      ebolavirus infection in suspect patients. The RT-PCR and antigen-capture 
      diagnostic assays proved very effective for detecting ebolavirus in patient 
      serum, plasma, and whole blood. In samples collected very early in the course of 
      infection, the RT-PCR assay could detect ebolavirus 24 to 48 h prior to detection 
      by antigen capture. More than 1,000 blood samples were collected, with multiple 
      samples obtained from many patients throughout the course of infection. Real-time 
      quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine the viral load in multiple samples from 
      patients with fatal and nonfatal cases, and these data were correlated with the 
      disease outcome. RNA copy levels in patients who died averaged 2 log(10) higher 
      than those in patients who survived. Using clinical material from multiple EHF 
      patients, we sequenced the variable region of the glycoprotein. This Sudan 
      ebolavirus strain was not derived from either the earlier Boniface (1976) or 
      Maleo (1979) strain, but it shares a common ancestor with both. Furthermore, both 
      sequence and epidemiologic data are consistent with the outbreak having 
      originated from a single introduction into the human population.

AB  - We have conducted an international quality assurance study of filovirus, Lassa 
      virus, and orthopox virus PCR with 24 participants. Of the participating 
      laboratories, 45.8 and 66.7% detected virus in all plasma samples, which 
      contained > or = 5,000 and > or = 100,000 copies per ml, respectively. 
      Sensitivity levels were not significantly different between viruses. 
      False-negative results were attributable to a lack of sensitivity.

TI  - Rapid detection protocol for filoviruses.
PG  - 94-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of filovirus disease outbreaks has been increasing in 
      recent years. Although there have been advances in the developments of 
      diagnostics, field tests are rare. Apart from family members of infected 
      patients, health care workers are at high risk of being infected during the 
      initial phase of an outbreak. RT-PCR has been shown to be helpful in containing 
      outbreaks. OBJECTIVES: To develop Taqman-RT-PCR for the detection of Ebola-Zaire 
      virus (EBOV-Z), Ebola-Sudan virus (EBOV-S) and Marburg virus (MBGV). STUDY 
      DESIGN: Quantitative Taqman-RT-PCRs for the detection of these viruses were 
      developed and established on a portable Smartcycler TD. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: 
      All three assays were highly sensitive and specific. The mobility of the assay 
      system may help to contain future outbreaks.

TI  - Application of real-time PCR for testing antiviral compounds against Lassa virus, 
      SARS coronavirus and Ebola virus in vitro.
PG  - 209-15
AB  - This report describes the application of real-time PCR for testing antivirals 
      against highly pathogenic viruses such as Lassa virus, SARS coronavirus and Ebola 
      virus. The test combines classical cell culture with a quantitative real-time PCR 
      read-out. The assay for Lassa virus was validated with ribavirin, which showed an 
      IC(50) of 9 micrograms/ml. Small-scale screening identified a class of imidazole 
      nucleoside/nucleotide analogues with antiviral activity against Lassa virus. The 
      analogues contained either dinitrile or diester groups at the imidazole 
      4,5-positions, and many of which possessed an acyclic sugar or sugar phosphonate 
      moiety at the imidazole 1-position. The IC(50) values of the most active 
      compounds ranged from 5 to 21 micrograms/ml. The compounds also inhibited 
      replication of SARS coronavirus and Ebola virus in analogous assays, although to 
      a lesser extent than Lassa virus.

TI  - CD209L (L-SIGN) is a receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
PG  - 15748-53
AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor for SARS-CoV, the novel 
      coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome [Li, W. Moore, M. J., 
      Vasilieva, N., Sui, J., Wong, S. K., Berne, M. A., Somasundaran, M., Sullivan, J. 
      L., Luzuriaga, K., Greenough, T. C., et al. (2003) Nature 426, 450-454]. We have 
      identified a different human cellular glycoprotein that can serve as an 
      alternative receptor for SARS-CoV. A human lung cDNA library in vesicular 
      stomatitis virus G pseudotyped retrovirus was transduced into Chinese hamster 
      ovary cells, and the cells were sorted for binding of soluble SARS-CoV spike (S) 
      glycoproteins, S(590) and S(1180). Clones of transduced cells that bound SARS-CoV 
      S glycoprotein were inoculated with SARS-CoV, and increases in subgenomic viral 
      RNA from 1-16 h or more were detected by multiplex RT-PCR in four cloned cell 
      lines. Sequencing of the human lung cDNA inserts showed that each of the cloned 
      cell lines contained cDNA that encoded human CD209L, a C-type lectin (also called 
      L-SIGN). When the cDNA encoding CD209L from clone 2.27 was cloned and transfected 
      into Chinese hamster ovary cells, the cells expressed human CD209L glycoprotein 
      and became susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV. Immunohistochemistry showed 
      that CD209L is expressed in human lung in type II alveolar cells and endothelial 
      cells, both potential targets for SARS-CoV. Several other enveloped viruses 
      including Ebola and Sindbis also use CD209L as a portal of entry, and HIV and 
      hepatitis C virus can bind to CD209L on cell membranes but do not use it to 
      mediate virus entry. Our data suggest that the large S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV 
      may use both ACE2 and CD209L in virus infection and pathogenesis.

TI  - Ebola virus circulation in Africa: a balance between clinical expression and 
      epidemiological silence.
PG  - 210-7
AB  - Nearly thirty years after the first epidemics, Ebola virus (EBOV) remains hardly 
      described, its transmission unclear and its reservoir elusive. Soon after the 
      Ebola fever outbreak and virus discovery in 1976 and in order to investigate the 
      distribution of EBOV in Central Africa, several countries including a range of 
      ecological zones were investigated in the early 1980s, using extensive survey: 
      Central African Republic (CAR), Cameroon, Chad, Congo, Gabon and Equatorial 
      Guinea. Since 1992, ELISA antibody test along with a RT-PCR have been used to 
      detect specific virus antibodies and characterize viral RNA. The widely separated 
      geographic locations of outbreaks have suggested that the reservoir and the 
      transmission cycle of EBOV are probably closely associated with the rain forest 
      ecosystem, what is supported by the distribution of antibodies. The fact that 
      outbreaks seldom occur suggests the presence of a rare or ecologically isolated 
      animal reservoir having few contacts with humans and non-human primates. However 
      various serological investigations showed a high prevalence in humans without any 
      pathology reported. This suggests a circulation of both pathogenic and 
      non-pathogenic strains as well as more frequent contacts with man than expected, 
      and could partially explain fifteen years of Ebola fever silence between the 
      emergence and re-emergence of Ebola virus in the Congolese basin. Nowadays, 
      largely enlightened by the study of recent epizootic and epidemic manifestations 
      of EBOV in Gabon and neighboring countries, EBOV natural history starts to be 
      understood as for the fundamentals of epizootic in non-human primates and chains 
      of transmission.

TI  - [Multiple Ebola virus haemorrhagic fever outbreaks in Gabon, from October 2001 to 
      April 2002].
PG  - 224-9
AB  - Outbreaks of Ebola virus haemorrhagic fever have been reported from 1994 to 1996 
      in the province of Ogooue Ivindo, a forest zone situated in the Northeast of 
      Gabon. Each time, the great primates had been identified as the initial source of 
      human infection. End of November 2001 a new alert came from this province, 
      rapidly confirmed as a EVHV outbreak. The response was given by the Ministry of 
      Health with the help of an international team under the aegis of WHO. An active 
      monitoring system was implemented in the three districts hit by the epidemic 
      (Zadie, Ivindo and Mpassa) to organize the detection of cases and their 
      follow-up. A case definition has been set up, the suspected cases were isolated 
      at hospital, at home or in lazarets and serological tests were performed. These 
      tests consisted of the detection of antigen or specific IgG and the RT-PCR. A 
      classification of cases was made according to the results of biological tests, 
      clinical and epidemiological data. The contact subjects were kept watch over for 
      21 days. 65 cases were recorded among which 53 deaths. The first human case, a 
      hunter died on the 28th of October 2001. The epidemic spreads over through family 
      transmission and nosocomial contamination. Four distinct primary foci have been 
      identified together with an isolated case situated in the South East of Gabon, 
      580 km away from the epicenter. Deaths happened within a delay of 6 days. The 
      last death has been recorded on the 22nd of March 2002 and the end of the 
      outbreak was declared on the 6th of May 2002. The epidemic spreads over the Gabon 
      just next. Unexplained deaths of animals had been mentionned in the nearby 
      forests as soon as August 2001: great primates and cephalophus. Samples taken 
      from their carcasses confirmed a concomitant animal epidemic.

TI  - Detection of Ebola virus in oral fluid specimens during outbreaks of Ebola virus 
      hemorrhagic fever in the Republic of Congo.
PG  - 1521-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients who have refused to provide blood samples has meant that 
      there have been significant delays in confirming outbreaks of Ebola virus 
      hemorrhagic fever (EVHF). During the 2 EVHF outbreaks in the Republic of Congo in 
      2003, we assessed the use of oral fluid specimens versus serum samples for 
      laboratory confirmation of cases of EVHF. METHODS: Serum and oral fluid specimens 
      were obtained from 24 patients with suspected Ebola and 10 healthy control 
      subjects. Specimens were analyzed for immunoglobulin G antibodies by 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and for Ebola virus by antigen 
      detection ELISA and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 
      Oral fluid specimens were collected with a commercially available collection 
      device. RESULTS: We failed to detect antibodies against Ebola in the oral fluid 
      specimens obtained from patients whose serum samples were seropositive. All 
      patients with positive serum RT-PCR results also had positive results for their 
      oral fluid specimens. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the usefulness of oral 
      fluid samples for the investigation of Ebola outbreaks, but further development 
      in antibodies and antigen detection in oral fluid specimens is needed before 
      these samples are used for filovirus surveillance activities in Africa.

TI  - Ebola virus VP35-VP40 interaction is sufficient for packaging 3E-5E minigenome 
      RNA into virus-like particles.
PG  - 5135-44
AB  - The packaging of viral genomic RNA into nucleocapsids and subsequently into 
      virions is not completely understood. Phosphoprotein (P) and nucleoprotein (NP) 
      interactions link NP-RNA complexes with P-L (polymerase) complexes to form viral 
      nucleocapsids. The nucleocapsid then interacts with the viral matrix protein, 
      leading to specific packaging of the nucleocapsid into the virion. A mammalian 
      two-hybrid assay and confocal microscopy were used to demonstrate that Ebola 
      virus VP35 and VP40 interact and colocalize in transfected cells. VP35 was 
      packaged into budding virus-like particles (VLPs) as observed by protease 
      protection assays. Moreover, VP40 and VP35 were sufficient for packaging an Ebola 
      virus minigenome RNA into VLPs. Results from immunoprecipitation-reverse 
      transcriptase PCR experiments suggest that VP35 confers specificity of the 
      nucleocapsid for viral genomic RNA by direct VP35-RNA interactions.

TI  - Marburgvirus genomics and association with a large hemorrhagic fever outbreak in 
      Angola.
PG  - 6497-516
AB  - In March 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) investigated 
      a large hemorrhagic fever (HF) outbreak in Uige Province in northern Angola, West 
      Africa. In total, 15 initial specimens were sent to CDC, Atlanta, Ga., for 
      testing for viruses associated with viral HFs known to be present in West Africa, 
      including ebolavirus. Marburgvirus was also included despite the fact that the 
      origins of all earlier outbreaks were linked directly to East Africa. 
      Surprisingly, marburgvirus was confirmed (12 of 15 specimens) as the cause of the 
      outbreak. The outbreak likely began in October 2004 and ended in July 2005, and 
      it included 252 cases and 227 (90%) fatalities (report from the Ministry of 
      Health, Republic of Angola, 2005), making it the largest Marburg HF outbreak on 
      record. A real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assay utilized and 
      adapted during the outbreak proved to be highly sensitive and sufficiently robust 
      for field use. Partial marburgvirus RNA sequence analysis revealed up to 21% 
      nucleotide divergence among the previously characterized East African strains, 
      with the most distinct being Ravn from Kenya (1987). The Angolan strain was less 
      different ( approximately 7%) from the main group of East African marburgviruses 
      than one might expect given the large geographic separation. To more precisely 
      analyze the virus genetic differences between outbreaks and among viruses within 
      the Angola outbreak itself, a total of 16 complete virus genomes were determined, 
      including those of the virus isolates Ravn (Kenya, 1987) and 05DRC, 07DRC, and 
      09DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo, 1998) and the reference Angolan virus 
      isolate (Ang1379v). In addition, complete genome sequences were obtained from 
      RNAs extracted from 10 clinical specimens reflecting various stages of the 
      disease and locations within the Angolan outbreak. While the marburgviruses 
      exhibit high overall genetic diversity (up to 22%), only 6.8% nucleotide 
      difference was found between the West African Angolan viruses and the majority of 
      East African viruses, suggesting that the virus reservoir species in these 
      regions are not substantially distinct. Remarkably few nucleotide differences 
      were found among the Angolan clinical specimens (0 to 0.07%), consistent with an 
      outbreak scenario in which a single (or rare) introduction of virus from the 
      reservoir species into the human population was followed by person-to-person 
      transmission with little accumulation of mutations. This is in contrast to the 
      1998 to 2000 marburgvirus outbreak, where evidence of several virus genetic 
      lineages (with up to 21% divergence) and multiple virus introductions into the 
      human population was found.

      (MuLV), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), Rabies or the rabies-related 
      Mokola virus encoding LacZ as a reporter gene was evaluated qualitatively and 
      quantitatively in human skin xenografts. High transgene expression was detected 
      in dermal fibroblasts transduced with VSV-G-, EboZ- or MuLV-pseudotyped HIV 
      vector with tissue irregularities in the dermal compartments following repeated 
      injections of EboZ- or LCMV-pseudotyped vectors. Four weeks after transduction, 
      double-labeling immunofluorescence of beta-galactosidase and involucrin or 
      integrin beta1 demonstrated that VSV-G-, EboZ- or MuLV-pseudotyped HIV vector 
      effectively targeted quiescent epidermal stem cells which underwent terminal 
      differentiation resulting in transgene expression in their progenies. Among the 
      six different pseudotyped HIV-based vectors evaluated, VSV-G-pseudotyped vector 
      was found to be the most efficient viral glycoprotein for cutaneous transduction 
      as demonstrated by the highest level of beta-galactosidase expression and genome 
      copy number evaluated by TaqMan PCR.

PG  - S193-8
AB  - Between the months of April and June 2004, an Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) 
      outbreak was reported in Yambio county, southern Sudan. Blood samples were 
      collected from a total of 36 patients with suspected EHF and were tested by 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for immunoglobulin G and M antibodies, 
      antigen ELISA, and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of a 
      segment of the Ebolavirus (EBOV) polymerase gene. A total of 13 patients were 
      confirmed to be infected with EBOV. In addition, 4 fatal cases were classified as 
      probable cases, because no samples were collected. Another 12 patients were 
      confirmed to have acute measles infection during the same period that EBOV was 
      circulating. Genetic analysis of PCR-positive samples indicated that the virus 
      was similar to but distinct from Sudan EBOV Maleo 1979. In response, case 
      management, social mobilization, and follow-up of contacts were set up as means 
      of surveillance. The outbreak was declared to be over on 7 August 2004.

PG  - 39-42

AB  - BACKGROUND: Isolating amplifiable RNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 
      (FFPE) tissues is more difficult than isolating DNA because of RNases, chemical 
      modification of the RNA, and cross-linking of nucleic acids and proteins. Tissues 
      containing infectious disease agents that require biosafety level (BSL)-3 and -4 
      necessitate fixation times of 21 and 30 days, respectively. OBJECTIVE: To improve 
      procedures for extracting RNA from these FFPE tissues and detect the RNA with the 
      more sensitive TaqManbased reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. STUDY DESIGN: Through 
      a single modification of a commercially available kit, we were able to extract 
      amplifiable RNA and detect West Nile virus (WNV), Marburg virus (MARV), and Ebola 
      virus (EBOV)-infected tissues using TaqMan assays. RESULTS: Formalin fixation 
      results in an approximately 2log(10) reduction in detection limit when compared 
      to fresh tissues. Increasing proteinase K digestion (24h) improved extraction of 
      amplifiable RNA from FFPE tissues. The TaqMan results were comparable to more 
      traditional detection results such as virus isolation. CONCLUSION: This improved 
      extraction procedure for obtaining RNA combined with the TaqMan RT-PCR assays 
      permit retrospective and prospective studies on FFPE tissues infected with BSL-3 
      and -4 pathogens.

PG  - 29-33
LID - 10.1016/j.jviromet.2009.02.021 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to design and construct a non-virulent simulant to 
      replace several pathogenic viruses in the development of detection and 
      identification methods in biodefense. A non-infectious simulant was designed and 
      engineered to include the nucleic acid signature of VEEV (Venezuelan Equine 
      Encephalitis virus), Influenza virus, Rift Valley Fever virus, Machupo virus, 
      Lassa virus, Yellow Fever virus, Ebola virus, Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus, 
      Junin virus, Marburg virus, Dengue virus, and Crimean-Congo virus, all in a 
      single construct. The nucleic acid sequences of all isolates available for each 
      virus species were aligned using ClustalW software in order to obtain conserved 
      regions of the viral genomes. Specific primers were designed to permit the 
      identification and differentiation between viral threat agents. A chimera of 3143 
      base pairs was engineered to produce 13 PCR amplicons of different sizes. PCR 
      amplification of the simulant with virus-specific primers revealed products of 
      the predicted length, in bands of similar intensity, and without detectable 
      unspecific products by electrophoresis analysis. The simulant described could 
      reduce the need to use infectious viruses in the development of detection and 
      diagnostic methods, and could also be useful as a non-virulent positive control 
      in nucleic acid-based tests against biological threat agents.

AB  - Rapid and effective detection and identification of emerging microbiological 
      threats and potential biowarfare agents is very challenging when using 
      traditional culture-based methods. Contemporary molecular techniques, relying 
      upon reverse transcription and/or polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR/PCR) provide 
      a rapid and effective alternative, however, such assays are generally designed 
      and optimized to detect only a limited number of targets, and seldom are capable 
      of differentiation among variants of detected targets. To meet these challenges, 
      we have designed a broad-range resequencing pathogen microarray (RPM) for 
      detection of tropical and emerging infectious agents (TEI) including biothreat 
      agents: RPM-TEI v 1.0 (RPM-TEI). The scope of the RPM-TEI assay enables detection 
      and differential identification of 84 types of pathogens and 13 toxin genes, 
      including most of the class A, B and C select agents as defined by the Centers 
      for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Atlanta, GA). Due to the high risks 
      associated with handling these particular target pathogens, the sensitivity 
      validation of the RPM-TEI has been performed using an innovative approach, in 
      which synthetic DNA fragments are used as templates for testing the assay's limit 
      of detection (LOD). Assay specificity and sensitivity was subsequently confirmed 
      by testing with full-length genomic nucleic acids of selected agents. The LOD for 
      a majority of the agents detected by RPM-TEI was determined to be at least 10(4) 
      copies per test. Our results also show that the RPM-TEI assay not only detects 
      and identifies agents, but is also able to differentiate near neighbors of the 
      same agent types, such as closely related strains of filoviruses of the Ebola 
      Zaire group, or the Machupo and Lassa arenaviruses. Furthermore, each RPM-TEI 
      assay results in specimen-specific agent gene sequence information that can be 
      used to assess pathogenicity, mutations, and virulence markers, results that are 
      not generally available from multiplexed RT-PCR/PCR-based detection assays.

TI  - Identification of SARS-like coronaviruses in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus 
      hipposideros) in Slovenia.
PG  - 507-14
LID - 10.1007/s00705-010-0612-5 [doi]
AB  - Bats have been identified as a natural reservoir for an increasing number of 
      emerging zoonotic viruses, such as Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Ebola virus, 
      Marburg virus, rabies and other lyssaviruses. Recently, a large number of viruses 
      closely related to members of the genus Coronavirus have been associated with 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and detected in bat species. In this 
      study, samples were collected from 106 live bats of seven different bat species 
      from 27 different locations in Slovenia. Coronaviruses were detected by RT-PCR in 
      14 out of 36 horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) fecal samples, with 38.8% 
      virus prevalence. Sequence analysis of a 405-nucleotide region of the highly 
      conserved RNA polymerase gene (pol) showed that all coronaviruses detected in 
      this study are genetically closely related, with 99.5-100% nucleotide identity, 
      and belong to group 2 of the coronaviruses. The most closely related virus 
      sequence in GenBank was SARS bat isolate Rp3/2004 (DQ071615) within the SARS-like 
      CoV cluster, sharing 85% nucleotide identity and 95.6% amino acid identity. The 
      potential risk of a new group of bat coronaviruses as a reservoir for human 
      infections is highly suspected, and further molecular epidemiologic studies of 
      these bat coronaviruses are needed.

TI  - Simultaneous Detection of CDC Category "A" DNA and RNA Bioterrorism Agents by Use 
      of Multiplex PCR & RT-PCR Enzyme Hybridization Assays.
PG  - 441-459
AB  - Assays to simultaneously detect multiple potential agents of bioterrorism are 
      limited. Two multiplex PCR and RT-PCR enzyme hybridization assays (mPCR-EHA, 
      mRT-PCR-EHA) were developed to simultaneously detect many of the CDC category "A" 
      bioterrorism agents. The "Bio T" DNA assay was developed to detect: Variola major 
      (VM), Bacillus anthracis (BA), Yersinia pestis (YP), Francisella tularensis (FT) 
      and Varicella zoster virus (VZV). The "Bio T" RNA assay (mRT-PCR-EHA) was 
      developed to detect: Ebola virus (Ebola), Lassa fever virus (Lassa), Rift Valley 
      fever (RVF), Hantavirus Sin Nombre species (HSN) and dengue virus (serotypes 
      1-4). Sensitivity and specificity of the 2 assays were tested by using genomic 
      DNA, recombinant plasmid positive controls, RNA transcripts controls, surrogate 
      (spiked) clinical samples and common respiratory pathogens. The analytical 
      sensitivity (limit of detection (LOD)) of the DNA asssay for genomic DNA was 
      1x10(0)~1x10(2) copies/mL for BA, FT and YP. The LOD for VZV whole organism was 
      1x10(-2) TCID(50)/mL. The LOD for recombinant controls ranged from 
      1x10(2)~1x10(3)copies/mL for BA, FT, YP and VM. The RNA assay demonstrated LOD 
      for RNA transcript controls of 1x10(4)~1x10(6) copies/mL without extraction and 
      1x10(5)~1x10(6) copies/mL with extraction for Ebola, RVF, Lassa and HSN. The LOD 
      for dengue whole organisms was ~1x10(-4) dilution for dengue 1 and 2, 1x10(4) 
      LD(50)/mL and 1x10(2) LD(50)/mL for dengue 3 and 4. The LOD without extraction 
      for recombinant plasmid DNA controls was ~1x10(3) copies/mL (1.5 input 
      copies/reaction) for Ebola, RVF, Lassa and HSN. No cross-reactivity of primers 
      and probes used in both assays was detected with common respiratory pathogens or 
      between targeted analytes. Clinical sensitivity was estimated using 264 surrogate 
      clinical samples tested with the BioT DNA assay and 549 samples tested with the 
      BioT RNA assay. The clinical specificity is 99.6% and 99.8% for BioT DNA assay 
      and BioT RNA assay, respectively. The surrogate sensitivities of these two assays 
      were 100% (95%CI 83-100) for FT, BA (pX02), YP, VM, VZV, dengue 2,3,4 and 95% 
      (95%CI 75-100) for BA (pX01) and dengue 1 using spiked clinical specimens. The 
      specificity of both BioT multiplex assays on spiked specimens was 100% (95% CI 
      99-100). Compared to other available assays (culture, serology, PCR, etc.) both 
      the BioT DNA mPCR-EHA and BioT RNA mRT-PCR-EHA are rapid, sensitive and specific 
      assays for detecting many category "A" Bioterrorism agents using a standard 
      thermocycler.

TI  - Development and evaluation of a simple assay for Marburg virus detection using a 
      reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification method.

AB  - Marburg virus (MARV) causes a severe hemorrhagic fever in humans with a high 
      mortality rate. The rapid and accurate identification of the virus is required to 
      appropriately provide infection control and outbreak management. Here, we 
      developed and evaluated a one-step reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal 
      amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the rapid and simple detection of MARV. By 
      combining two sets of primers specific for the Musoke and Ravn genetic lineages, 
      a multiple RT-LAMP assay detected MARV strains of both lineages, and no 
      cross-reactivity with other hemorrhagic fever viruses (Ebola virus and Lassa 
      virus) was observed. The assay could detect 10(2) copies of the viral RNA per 
      tube within 40 min by real-time monitoring of the turbidities of the reaction 
      mixtures. The assay was further evaluated using viral RNA extracted from clinical 
      specimens collected in the 2005 Marburg hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Angola and 
      yielded positive results for samples containing MARV at greater than 10(4) 50% 
      tissue culture infective doses/ml, exhibiting 78% (14 of 18 samples positive) 
      consistency with the results of a reverse transcription-PCR assay carried out in 
      the field laboratory. The results obtained by both agarose gel electrophoresis 
      and naked-eye judgment indicated that the RT-LAMP assay developed in this study 
      is an effective tool for the molecular detection of MARV. Furthermore, it seems 
      suitable for use for field diagnostics or in laboratories in areas where MARV is 
      endemic.

      hantaviruses.
PG  - 954-60
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2010.09-0636 [doi]
AB  - Viral hemorrhagic fever is caused by a diverse group of single-stranded, 
      negative-sense or positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to the families 
      Filoviridae (Ebola and Marburg), Arenaviridae (Lassa, Junin, Machupo, Sabia, and 
      Guanarito), and Bunyaviridae (hantavirus). Disease characteristics in these 
      families mark each with the potential to be used as a biological threat agent. 
      Because other diseases have similar clinical symptoms, specific laboratory 
      diagnostic tests are necessary to provide the differential diagnosis during 
      outbreaks and for instituting acceptable quarantine procedures. We designed 48 
      TaqMan-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for specific and absolute 
      quantitative detection of multiple hemorrhagic fever viruses. Forty-six assays 
      were determined to be virus-specific, and two were designated as pan assays for 
      Marburg virus. The limit of detection for the assays ranged from 10 to 0.001 
      plaque-forming units (PFU)/PCR. Although these real-time hemorrhagic fever virus 
      assays are qualitative (presence of target), they are also quantitative (measure 
      a single DNA/RNA target sequence in an unknown sample and express the final 
      results as an absolute value (e.g., viral load, PFUs, or copies/mL) on the basis 
      of concentration of standard samples and can be used in viral load, vaccine, and 
      antiviral drug studies.

AB  - Ebola virus (EBOV) causes severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans and non-human 
      primates. While the role of the EBOV major matrix protein VP40 in morphogenesis 
      is well understood, nothing is known about its contributions to the regulation of 
      viral genome replication and/or transcription. Similarly, while it was reported 
      that the minor matrix protein VP24 impairs viral genome replication, it remains 
      unclear whether it also regulates transcription, since all common experimental 
      systems measure the combined products of replication and transcription. We have 
      developed systems that allow the independent monitoring of viral transcription 
      and replication, based on qRT-PCR and a replication-deficient minigenome. Using 
      these systems we show that VP24 regulates not only viral genome replication, but 
      also transcription. Further, we show for the first time that VP40 is also 
      involved in regulating these processes. These functions are conserved among EBOV 
      species and, in the case of VP40, independent of its budding or RNA-binding 
      functions.

AB  - Filoviruses such as Ebola (EBOV) and Marburg (MARV) are single-stranded negative 
      sense RNA viruses that cause acute hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates. 
      Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics to counter filovirus 
      infections in humans. The development of higher throughput/high-content primary 
      screening assays followed by validation using the low-throughput traditional 
      plaque or real-time PCR assays will greatly aid efforts toward the discovery of 
      novel antiviral therapeutics. Specifically, high-content imaging technology is 
      increasingly being applied for primary drug screening. In this study, the authors 
      describe the challenges encountered when optimizing bioassays based on image 
      acquisition and analyses for the highly pathogenic filoviruses Ebola and Marburg. 
      A number of biological and imaging-related variables such as plating density, 
      multiplicity of infection, the number of fields scanned per well, fluorescence 
      intensity, and the cell number analyzed were evaluated during the development of 
      these assays. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate the benefits related to the 
      statistical analyses of single-cell data to account for heterogeneity in the 
      subcellular localization and whole-cell integrated intensity of the viral antigen 
      staining pattern. In conclusion, they show that image-based methods represent 
      powerful screening tools for identifying antiviral compounds for highly 
      pathogenic viruses.

TI  - Cross-platform evaluation of commercial real-time reverse transcription PCR 
      master mix kits using a quantitative 5'nuclease assay for Ebola virus.
PG  - 370-5
LID - 10.1016/j.mcp.2010.08.004 [doi]
AB  - Selection of optimal reaction master mix reagents is essential to obtain the best 
      performance with diagnostic real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain 
      reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Every year the number of commercially available master 
      mix kits increases, so it is prudent to periodically evaluate kits on the market. 
      In this study we evaluated five commercial real-time RT-PCR master mix kits, the 
      RealMasterMix RT-PCR ROX kit, the AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR kit, the SuperScript 
      III Platinum One-step Quantitative RT-PCR system, the QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR 
      kit, and the LightCycler RNA HybProbe amplification kit, using a 5'nuclease assay 
      for Ebola virus. The kits were evaluated using the manufacturer's recommended 
      conditions, as well as conditions which have been used with the Ebola virus assay 
      during outbreaks. When evaluated for use in Ebola virus RNA detection, the 
      AgPath-ID kit resulted in the greatest sensitivity in comparison to the other 
      four kits. The efficacy of the AgPath-ID kit was instrument-independent in the 
      five real-time PCR platforms tested. This study demonstrated that Ebola virus RNA 
      detection was not equivalent among the master mix reagents studied and, thus, 
      that this variable can affect real-time RT-PCR assay sensitivity. Furthermore, 
      this study rates the master mix reagents for their suitability, providing 
      diagnostic laboratories the option to select from these kits to suit their 
      specific laboratory needs for real-time RT-PCR.

AB  - The filoviruses, Marburg virus (MARV) and Ebola virus (EBOV), are causative 
      agents of severe hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates in humans and 
      non-human primates. Sporadic outbreaks of filovirus infection have occurred in 
      Central Africa and parts of Asia. Identification of the natural reservoir animals 
      that are unknown yet and epidemiological investigations are current challenges to 
      forestall outbreaks of filovirus diseases. The filovirus species identified 
      currently include one in the MARV group and five in the EBOV group, with large 
      genetic variations found among the species. Therefore, it has been difficult to 
      develop a single sensitive assay to detect all filovirus species, which would 
      advance laboratory diagnosis greatly in endemic areas. In this study, a highly 
      sensitive universal RT-PCR assay targeting the nucleoprotein (NP) gene of 
      filoviruses was developed. The genomic RNAs of all known MARV and EBOV species 
      were detected by using an NP-specific primer set. In addition, this RT-PCR 
      procedure was verified further for its application to detect viral RNAs in tissue 
      samples of animals infected experimentally and blood specimens of infected 
      patients. This assay will be a useful method for diagnostics and epidemiological 
      studies of filovirus infections.

TI  - [Indications for PCR in travel medicine].
PG  - 991-2, 994
AB  - The use of PCR-based molecular diagnosis in travel medicine remains limited to 
      specific indications such as clinical suspicion of some of the viral hemorrhagic 
      fevers (e.g. Ebola, Marburg), differential diagnosis between Entamoeba 
      histolytica (pathogen) and E. dispar (non pathogen) in the stools, and 
      parasitological diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The scope of indications is 
      likely to expand in the coming years with the development of techniques (e.g. 
      multiplex PCR) able to identify several pathogens from a single sample. 
      Simplification and cost-reduction of molecular techniques, which would allow for 
      more equitable access to these diagnostic tools in countries where the targeted 
      diseases are highly prevalent, pose major technological and ethical challenges.

TI  - Using next generation sequencing to identify yellow fever virus in Uganda.
PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.1016/j.virol.2011.08.024 [doi]
AB  - In October and November 2010, hospitals in northern Uganda reported patients with 
      suspected hemorrhagic fevers. Initial tests for Ebola viruses, Marburg virus, 
      Rift Valley fever virus, and Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus were negative. 
      Unbiased PCR amplification of total RNA extracted directly from patient sera and 
      next generation sequencing resulted in detection of yellow fever virus and 
      generation of 98% of the virus genome sequence. This finding demonstrated the 
      utility of next generation sequencing and a metagenomic approach to identify an 
      etiological agent and direct the response to a disease outbreak.

      laboratory, Hamburg, Germany.

AB  - A needlestick injury occurred during an animal experiment in the biosafety level 
      4 laboratory in Hamburg, Germany, in March 2009. The syringe contained Zaire 
      ebolavirus (ZEBOV) mixed with Freund's adjuvant. Neither an approved treatment 
      nor a postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) exists for Ebola hemorrhagic fever. 
      Following a risk-benefit assessment, it was recommended the exposed person take 
      an experimental vaccine that had shown PEP efficacy in ZEBOV-infected nonhuman 
      primates (NHPs) [12]. The vaccine, which had not been used previously in humans, 
      was a live-attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (recVSV) expressing 
      the glycoprotein of ZEBOV. A single dose of 5 x 10(7) plaque-forming units was 
      injected 48 hours after the accident. The vaccinee developed fever 12 hours later 
      and recVSV viremia was detectable by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for 2 days. 
      Otherwise, the person remained healthy, and ZEBOV RNA, except for the 
      glycoprotein gene expressed in the vaccine, was never detected in serum and 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the 3-week observation period.

AB  - Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) infections are associated with high lethality in 
      primates. ZEBOV primarily targets mononuclear phagocytes, which are activated 
      upon infection and secrete mediators believed to trigger initial stages of 
      pathogenesis. The characterization of the responses of target cells to ZEBOV 
      infection may therefore not only further understanding of pathogenesis but also 
      suggest possible points of therapeutic intervention. Gene expression profiles of 
      primary human macrophages exposed to ZEBOV were determined using DNA microarrays 
      and quantitative PCR to gain insight into the cellular response immediately after 
      cell entry. Significant changes in mRNA concentrations encoding for 88 cellular 
      proteins were observed. Most of these proteins have not yet been implicated in 
      ZEBOV infection. Some, however, are inflammatory mediators known to be elevated 
      during the acute phase of disease in the blood of ZEBOV-infected humans. 
      Interestingly, the cellular response occurred within the first hour of Ebola 
      virion exposure, i.e. prior to virus gene expression. This observation supports 
      the hypothesis that virion binding or entry mediated by the spike glycoprotein 
      (GP(1,2)) is the primary stimulus for an initial response. Indeed, ZEBOV virions, 
      LPS, and virus-like particles consisting of only the ZEBOV matrix protein VP40 
      and GP(1,2) (VLP(VP40-GP)) triggered comparable responses in macrophages, 
      including pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic signals. In contrast, VLP(VP40) 
      (particles lacking GP(1,2)) caused an aberrant response. This suggests that 
      GP(1,2) binding to macrophages plays an important role in the immediate cellular 
      response.

AB  - We are developing inactivated and live-attenuated rabies virus (RABV) vaccines 
      expressing Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein for use in humans and endangered 
      wildlife, respectively. Here, we further characterize the pathogenesis of the 
      live-attenuated RABV/EBOV vaccine candidates in mice in an effort to define their 
      growth properties and potential for safety. RABV vaccines expressing GP (RV-GP) 
      or a replication-deficient derivative with a deletion of the RABV G gene 
      (RVDeltaG-GP) are both avirulent after intracerebral inoculation of adult mice. 
      Furthermore, RVDeltaG-GP is completely avirulent upon intracerebral inoculation of 
      suckling mice unlike parental RABV vaccine or RV-GP. Analysis of RVDeltaG-GP in the 
      brain by quantitative PCR, determination of virus titer, and immunohistochemistry 
      indicated greatly restricted virus replication. In summary, our findings indicate 
      that RV-GP retains the attenuation phenotype of the live-attenuated RABV vaccine, 
      and RVDeltaG-GP would appear to be an even safer alternative for use in wildlife or 
      consideration for human use.

TI  - Reston virus in domestic pigs in China.

AB  - Historically, Reston virus (RESTV) has been found to be associated with outbreaks 
      of disease only in nonhuman primates. Its spread to domestic pigs was reported 
      for the first time in 2008. In this study, we report the discovery, molecular 
      detection, and phylogenetic analysis of Reston virus (RESTV) in domestic pigs in 
      China. A total of 137 spleen specimens from pigs that died after showing typical 
      clinical signs of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), and for 
      which infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) 
      was confirmed by RT-PCR, were collected from three farms in Shanghai from 
      February to September 2011. Of these samples, 2.92 % (4/137) were found to be 
      positive for RESTV. All of the positive piglets were under the age of 8 weeks and 
      were co-infected with PRRSV. Sequences were found that shared 96.1 %-98.9 % 
      sequence similarity with those of two RESTV variants that had been discovered 
      previously in domestic pigs and cynomolgus macaques from the Philippines. We 
      therefore conclude that RESTV was present in domestic pigs in Shanghai, China.

AB  - Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV) are causative agents of severe 
      hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates in humans and non-human primates and 
      there is currently no licensed vaccine or therapeutics. To date, there is no 
      specific laboratory diagnostic test in China, while there is a national need to 
      provide differential diagnosis during outbreaks and for instituting acceptable 
      quarantine procedures. In this study, the TaqMan RT-PCR assays targeting the 
      nucleoprotein genes of the Zaire Ebolavirus (ZEBOV) and MARV were developed and 
      their sensitivities and specificities were investigated. Our results indicated 
      that the assays were able to make reliable diagnosis over a wide range of virus 
      copies from 10(3) to 10(9), corresponding to the threshold of a standard RNA 
      transcript. The results showed that there were about 10(10) RNA copies per 
      milliliter of virus culture supernatant, equivalent to 10,000 RNA molecules per 
      infectious virion, suggesting the presence of many non-infectious particles. 
      These data indicated that the TaqMan RT-PCR assays developed in this study will 
      be suitable for future surveillance and specific diagnosis of ZEBOV and MARV in 
      China.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Marburg virus and Ebola virus are acute infections with high case 
      fatality rates. A rapid, sensitive detection method was established to detect 
      Marburg virus and Ebola virus by multiplex real-time fluorescence quantitative 
      PCR. METHODS: Designing primers and Taqman probes from highly conserved sequences 
      of Marburg virus and Ebola virus through whole genome sequences alignment, Taqman 
      probes labeled by FAM and Texas Red, the sensitivity of the multiplex real-time 
      quantitative PCR assay was optimized by evaluating the different concentrations 
      of primers and Probes. RESULTS: We have developed a real-time PCR method with the 
      sensitivity of 30.5 copies/microl for Marburg virus positive plasmid and 28.6 
      copies/microl for Ebola virus positive plasmids, Japanese encephalitis virus, 
      Yellow fever virus, Dengue virus were using to examine the specificity. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The Multiplex real-time PCR assays provide a sensitive, reliable and 
      efficient method to detect Marburg virus and Ebola virus simultaneously.

TI  - The Role of the Charged Residues of the GP2 Helical Regions in Ebola Entry().
PG  - 121-135
AB  - The glycoprotein (GP) of Ebola is the sole structural protein that forms the 
      spikes on the viral envelope. The GP contains two subunits, GP1 and GP2, linked 
      by a disulfide bond, which are responsible for receptor binding and membrane 
      fusion, respectively. In this study, the full length of GP gene of Ebola Zaire 
      species, 2028 base pairs in length, was synthesized using 38 overlapping 
      oligonucleotides by multiple rounds of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The 
      synthesized GP gene was shown to be efficiently expressed in mammalian cells. 
      Furthermore, an efficient HIV-based pseudotyping system was developed using the 
      synthetic GP gene, providing a safe approach to dissecting the entry mechanism of 
      Ebola viruses. Using this pseudotyping system and mutational analysis, the role 
      of the charged residues in the GP2 helical regions was examined. It was found 
      that substitutions of the most charged residues in the regions did not adversely 
      affect GP expression, processing, or viral incorporation, however, most of the 
      mutations greatly impaired the ability of GP to mediate efficient viral 
      infection. These results demonstrate that these charged residues of GP2 play an 
      important role in GP-mediated Ebola entry into its host cells. We propose that 
      these charged residues are involved in forming the intermediate conformation(s) 
      of GP in membrane fusion and Ebola entry.

AB  - In order to establish a rapid and accurate method for the detection of Ebola 
      virus (EBOV), the primers used in SYBR Green I real-time RT-PCR were designed 
      based on the EBOV NP gene sequences published in GenBank. The SYBR Green I 
      real-time RT-PCR was established and optimized for the detection of EBOV. The 
      EBOV RNA that was transcribed in vitro was used as a template. The sensitivity of 
      this method was found to reach 1.0 x 10(2) copies/microL and the detection range 
      was 10(2) - 10(10). No cross reaction with RNA samples from Marburg virus, Dengue 
      virus, Xinjiang hemorrhagic fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Influenza 
      virus (H1N1 and H3N2) and Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus E 
      genomic RNA was found. The method would be useful for the detection and 
      monitoring of EBOV in China.

TI  - A mutation in the Ebola virus envelope glycoprotein restricts viral entry in a 
      host species- and cell-type-specific manner.
PG  - 3324-34
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01598-12 [doi]
AB  - Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV) is a zoonotic pathogen that causes severe hemorrhagic 
      fever in humans. A single viral glycoprotein (GP) mediates viral attachment and 
      entry. Here, virus-like particle (VLP)-based entry assays demonstrate that a GP 
      mutant, GP-F88A, which is defective for entry into a variety of human cell types, 
      including antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as macrophages and dendritic 
      cells, can mediate viral entry into mouse CD11b(+) APCs. Like that of wild-type 
      GP (GP-wt), GP-F88A-mediated entry occurs via a macropinocytosis-related pathway 
      and requires endosomal cysteine proteases and an intact fusion peptide. Several 
      additional hydrophobic residues lie in close proximity to GP-F88, including L111, 
      I113, L122, and F225. GP mutants in which these residues are mutated to alanine 
      displayed preferential and often impaired entry into several cell types, although 
      not in a species-specific manner. Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein is an essential 
      filovirus receptor that binds directly to GP. Overexpression of NPC1 was recently 
      demonstrated to rescue GP-F88A-mediated entry. A quantitative enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) demonstrated that while the F88A mutation impairs GP 
      binding to human NPC1 by 10-fold, it has little impact on GP binding to mouse 
      NPC1. Interestingly, not all mouse macrophage cell lines permit GP-F88A entry. 
      The IC-21 cell line was permissive, whereas RAW 264.7 cells were not. 
      Quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays demonstrate higher NPC1 levels 
      in GP-F88A permissive IC-21 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages than in RAW 
      264.7 cells. Cumulatively, these studies suggest an important role for NPC1 in 
      the differential entry of GP-F88A into mouse versus human APCs.

AB  - To determine geographic range for Ebola virus, we tested 276 bats in Bangladesh. 
      Five (3.5%) bats were positive for antibodies against Ebola Zaire and Reston 
      viruses; no virus was detected by PCR. These bats might be a reservoir for Ebola 
      or Ebola-like viruses, and extend the range of filoviruses to mainland Asia.

      Ghana.

LID - e2435
AB  - BACKGROUND: Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF) are acute diseases associated with 
      bleeding, organ failure, and shock. VHF may hardly be distinguished clinically 
      from other diseases in the African hospital, including viral hepatitis. This 
      study was conducted to determine if VHF and viral hepatitis contribute to 
      hospital morbidity in the Central and Northern parts of Ghana. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From 2009 to 2011, blood samples of 258 patients 
      with VHF symptoms were collected at 18 hospitals in Ashanti, Brong-Ahafo, 
      Northern, Upper West, and Upper East regions. Patients were tested by PCR for 
      Lassa, Rift Valley, Crimean-Congo, Ebola/Marburg, and yellow fever viruses; 
      hepatitis A (HAV), B (HBV), C (HCV), and E (HEV) viruses; and by ELISA for 
      serological hepatitis markers. None of the patients tested positive for VHF. 
      However, 21 (8.1%) showed anti-HBc IgM plus HBV DNA and/or HBsAg; 37 (14%) showed 
      HBsAg and HBV DNA without anti-HBc IgM; 26 (10%) showed anti-HAV IgM and/or HAV 
      RNA; and 20 (7.8%) were HCV RNA-positive. None was positive for HEV RNA or 
      anti-HEV IgM plus IgG. Viral genotypes were determined as HAV-IB, HBV-A and E, 
      and HCV-1, 2, and 4. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: VHFs do not cause significant 
      hospital morbidity in the study area. However, the incidence of acute hepatitis A 
      and B, and hepatitis B and C with active virus replication is high. These 
      infections may mimic VHF and need to be considered if VHF is suspected. The data 
      may help decision makers to allocate resources and focus surveillance systems on 
      the diseases of relevance in Ghana.

AB  - Containment level 4 (CL4) laboratories studying biosafety level 4 viruses are 
      under strict regulations to conduct nonhuman primate (NHP) studies in compliance 
      of both animal welfare and biosafety requirements. NHPs housed in open-barred 
      cages raise concerns about cross-contamination between animals, and accidental 
      exposure of personnel to infectious materials. To address these concerns, two NHP 
      experiments were performed. One examined the simultaneous infection of 6 groups 
      of NHPs with 6 different viruses (Machupo, Junin, Rift Valley Fever, 
      Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever, Nipah and Hendra viruses). Washing personnel 
      between handling each NHP group, floor to ceiling biobubble with HEPA filter, and 
      plexiglass between cages were employed for partial primary containment. The 
      second experiment employed no primary containment around open barred cages with 
      Ebola virus infected NHPs 0.3 meters from naive NHPs. Viral antigen-specific 
      ELISAs, qRT-PCR and TCID50 infectious assays were utilized to determine antibody 
      levels and viral loads. No transmission of virus to neighbouring NHPs was 
      observed suggesting limited containment protocols are sufficient for multi-viral 
      CL4 experiments within one room. The results support the concept that Ebola virus 
      infection is self-contained in NHPs infected intramuscularly, at least in the 
      present experimental conditions, and is not transmitted to naive NHPs via an 
      airborne route.

AB  - A detailed understanding of the circulating pathogens in a particular geographic 
      location aids in effectively utilizing targeted, rapid diagnostic assays, thus 
      allowing for appropriate therapeutic and containment procedures. This is 
      especially important in regions prevalent for highly pathogenic viruses 
      co-circulating with other endemic pathogens such as the malaria parasite. The 
      importance of biosurveillance is highlighted by the ongoing Ebola virus disease 
      outbreak in West Africa. For example, a more comprehensive assessment of the 
      regional pathogens could have identified the risk of a filovirus disease outbreak 
      earlier and led to an improved diagnostic and response capacity in the region. In 
      this context, being able to rapidly screen a single sample for multiple pathogens 
      in a single tube reaction could improve both diagnostics as well as pathogen 
      surveillance. Here, probes were designed to capture identifying filovirus 
      sequence for the ebolaviruses Sudan, Ebola, Reston, Tai Forest, and Bundibugyo 
      and the Marburg virus variants Musoke, Ci67, and Angola. These probes were 
      combined into a single probe panel, and the captured filovirus sequence was 
      successfully identified using the MiSeq next-generation sequencing platform. This 
      panel was then used to identify the specific filovirus from nonhuman primates 
      experimentally infected with Ebola virus as well as Bundibugyo virus in human 
      sera samples from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, thus demonstrating the 
      utility for pathogen detection using clinical samples. While not as sensitive and 
      rapid as real-time PCR, this panel, along with incorporating additional sequence 
      capture probe panels, could be used for broad pathogen screening and 
      biosurveillance.

AB  - Ebola virus disease (EVD) developed in a patient who contracted the disease in

      treatment. During the course of the illness, he had numerous complications,

      supportive treatment consisting of high-volume fluid resuscitation (approximately 
      10 liters per day in the first 72 hours), broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and 
      ventilatory support resulted in full recovery without the use of experimental 
      therapies. Discharge was delayed owing to the detection of viral RNA in urine 
      (day 30) and sweat (at the last assessment on day 40) by means of 
      polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay, but the last positive culture was 
      identified in plasma on day 14 and in urine on day 26. This case shows the 
      challenges in the management of EVD and suggests that even severe EVD can be 
      treated effectively with routine intensive care.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The authors studied the epidemiological, clinical, and outcome 
      features of the Ebola virus disease in patients hospitalized at the Ebola 
      treatment center (ETC) in Conakry to identify clinical factors associated with 
      death. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted from March 25 to 
      August 20, 2014. The diagnosis of Ebola virus infection was made on real-time 
      PCR. RESULTS: Ninety patients, with a positive test result, were hospitalized. 
      Their mean age was 34.12+/-14.29 years and 63% were male patients. Most worked in 
      the informal sector (38%) and in the medical and paramedical staff (physicians 
      12%, nurses 6%, and laboratory technicians 1%). Most patients lived in the 
      Conakry suburbs (74%) and in Boffa (11%). The main clinical signs were physical 
      asthenia (80%) and fever (72%). Hemorrhagic signs were observed in 26% of 
      patients. The comparison of clinical manifestations showed that hiccups (P=0.04), 
      respiratory distress (P=0.04), and hemorrhagic symptoms (P=0.01) were more 
      frequent among patients who died. Malaria (72%) and diabetes (2%) were the most 
      frequent co-morbidities. The crude case fatality rate was 44% [95% confidence 
      interval (33-54%)]. The average hospital stay was 7.96+/-5.81 days. CONCLUSION: The 
      first Ebola outbreak in Conakry was characterized by the young age of patients, 
      discrete hemorrhagic signs related to lethality. Its control relies on a strict 
      use of preventive measures.

TI  - Evidence for declining numbers of Ebola cases--Montserrado County, Liberia, 
      June-October 2014.
PG  - 1072-6
AB  - The epidemic of Ebola virus disease (Ebola) in West Africa that began in March 
      2014 has caused approximately 13,200 suspected, probable, and confirmed cases, 
      including approximately 6,500 in Liberia. About 50% of Liberia's reported cases 
      have been in Montserrado County (population 1.5 million), the most populous 
      county, which contains the capital city, Monrovia. To examine the course of the 
      Ebola epidemic in Montserrado County, data on Ebola treatment unit (ETU) 
      admissions, laboratory testing of patient blood samples, and collection of dead 
      bodies were analyzed. Each of the three data sources indicated consistent 
      declines of 53%-73% following a peak incidence in mid-September. The declines in 
      ETU admissions, percentage of patients with reverse transcription-polymerase 
      chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results positive for Ebola, and dead bodies are the 
      first evidence of reduction in disease after implementation of multiple 
      prevention and response measures. The possible contributions of these 
      interventions to the decline is not yet fully understood or corroborated. A 
      reduction in cases suggests some progress; however, eliminating Ebola 
      transmission is the critical goal and will require greatly intensified efforts 
      for complete, high-quality surveillance to direct and drive the rapid 
      intervention, tracking, and response efforts that remain essential.

TI  - Detection panel for identification of twelve hemorrhagic viruses using real-time 
      RT-PCR.
PG  - 238-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Viral hemorrhagic fevers are caused by viruses from four viral 
      families and develop diseases with high fatality rates. However, no commercial 
      diagnostic assay for these pathogens is available. FINDINGS: We developed 
      real-time RT-PCR assays for viruses Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, Guanarito, Machupo, 
      Junin, Sabia, Seoul, Puumala, Hantaan, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and 
      Rift Valley fever virus. The assays were optimized for identical reaction 
      conditions and can be performed using several types of real-time PCR instruments, 
      both capillary and plate, including a portable Ruggedized Advanced Pathogen 
      Identification Device (R.A.P.I.D.) (Idaho Technology, Inc.). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      combination with primers and probes from previously published studies, we present 
      a simple system for rapid identification of hemorrhagic filoviruses, arenaviruses 
      and bunyaviruses with sufficient sensitivity for first contact laboratory and 
      diagnosis under field conditions.

AB  - Plasmodium falciparum malaria is highly endemic in the three most affected 
      countries in the current epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa. As 
      EVD and malaria are clinically indistinguishable, both remain part of the 
      differential diagnosis of ill travelers from returning from areas of EVD 
      transmission. We compared the performances of a rapid diagnostic test (BinaxNOW) 
      and real-time PCR with P. falciparum-positive specimens before and after heat and 
      Triton X-100 inactivation, and we documented no loss of sensitivity.

TI  - Evaluation of ViroCyt(R) Virus Counter for rapid filovirus quantitation.
PG  - 857-72
LID - 10.3390/v7030857 [doi]
AB  - Development and evaluation of medical countermeasures for diagnostics, vaccines, 
      and therapeutics requires production of standardized, reproducible, and well 
      characterized virus preparations. For filoviruses this includes plaque assay for 
      quantitation of infectious virus, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for 
      morphology and quantitation of virus particles, and real-time reverse 
      transcription PCR for quantitation of viral RNA (qRT-PCR). The ViroCyt(R) Virus 
      Counter (VC) 2100 (ViroCyt, Boulder, CO, USA) is a flow-based instrument capable 
      of quantifying virus particles in solution. Using a proprietary combination of 
      fluorescent dyes that stain both nucleic acid and protein in a single 30 min 
      step, rapid, reproducible, and cost-effective quantification of filovirus 
      particles was demonstrated. Using a seed stock of Ebola virus variant Kikwit, the 
      linear range of the instrument was determined to be 2.8E+06 to 1.0E+09 virus 
      particles per mL with coefficient of variation ranging from 9.4% to 31.5% for 
      samples tested in triplicate. VC particle counts for various filovirus stocks 
      were within one log of TEM particle counts. A linear relationship was established 
      between the plaque assay, qRT-PCR, and the VC. VC results significantly 
      correlated with both plaque assay and qRT-PCR. These results demonstrated that 
      the VC is an easy, fast, and consistent method to quantify filoviruses in stock 
      preparations.

AB  - Filoviruses are virulent human pathogens which cause severe illness with high 
      case fatality rates and for which there are no available FDA-approved vaccines or 
      therapeutics. Diagnostic tools including antibody- and molecular-based assays, 
      mass spectrometry, and next-generation sequencing are continually under 
      development. Assays using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have become the 
      mainstay for the detection of filoviruses in outbreak settings. In many cases, 
      real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR allows for the detection of filoviruses to be 
      carried out with minimal manipulation and equipment and can provide results in 
      less than 2 h. In cases of novel, highly diverse filoviruses, random-primed 
      pyrosequencing approaches have proved useful. Ideally, diagnostic tests would 
      allow for diagnosis of filovirus infection as early as possible after infection, 
      either before symptoms begin, in the event of a known exposure or epidemiologic 
      outbreak, or post-symptomatically. If tests could provide an early definitive 
      diagnosis, then this information may be used to inform the choice of possible 
      therapeutics. Several exciting new candidate therapeutics have been described 
      recently; molecules that have therapeutic activity when administered to animal 
      models of infection several days post-exposure, once signs of disease have begun. 
      The latest data for candidate nucleoside analogs, small interfering RNA (siRNA) 
      molecules, phosphorodiamidate (PMO) molecules, as well as antibody and 
      blood-product therapeutics and therapeutic vaccines are discussed. For filovirus 
      researchers and government agencies interested in making treatments available for 
      a nation's defense as well as its general public, having the right diagnostic 
      tools to identify filovirus infections, as well as a panel of available 
      therapeutics for treatment when needed, is a high priority. Additional research 
      in both areas is required for ultimate success, but significant progress is being 
      made to reach these goals.

TI  - Optimized microRNA purification from TRIzol-treated plasma.
PG  - 95
LID - 10.1186/s12864-015-1299-5 [doi]
LID - 95
AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent new and potentially informative 
      diagnostic targets for disease detection and prognosis. However, little work 
      exists documenting the effect of TRIzol, a common viral inactivation and nucleic 
      acid extraction reagent, on miRNA purification. Here, we developed an optimized 
      protocol for miRNA extraction from plasma samples by evaluating five different 
      RNA extraction kits, TRIzol phase separation, purification additives, and initial 
      plasma sample volume. This method was then used for downstream profiling of 
      plasma miRNAs found in archived samples from one nonhuman primate (NHP) 
      experimentally challenged with Ebola virus by the aerosol route. RESULTS: 
      Comparison of real-time RT-PCR results for spiked-in and endogenous miRNA 
      sequences determined extraction efficiencies from five different RNA purification 
      kits. These experiments showed that 50 muL plasma processed using the QIAGEN 
      miRNeasy Mini Kit with 5 mug of glycogen as a co-precipitant yielded the highest 
      recovery of endogenous miRNAs. Using this optimized protocol, miRNAs from 
      archived plasma samples of one rhesus macaque challenged with aerosolized Ebola 
      virus was profiled using a targeted real-time PCR array. A total of 519 of the 
      752 unique miRNAs assayed were present in the plasma samples at day 0 and day 7 
      (time of death) post-exposure. Statistical analyses revealed 25 sequences 
      significantly up- or down-regulated between day 0 and day 7 post infection, 
      validating the utility of the extraction method for plasma miRNA profiling. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the knowledgebase of circulating miRNA 
      extraction methods and expands on the potential applications of cell-free miRNA 
      profiling for diagnostics and pathogenesis studies. Specifically, we optimized an 
      extraction protocol for miRNAs from TRIzol-inactivated plasma samples that can be 
      used for highly pathogenic viruses.

      delays in the current West African EVD outbreak of 2014 and 2015, compromising 
      outbreak control. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the EVD bedside rapid 
      diagnostic antigen test (RDT) developed by the United Kingdom's Defence Science 
      and Technology Laboratory, compared with Ebola virus RT-PCR, in an operational 
      setting for EVD diagnosis of suspected cases admitted to Ebola holding units in 
      the Western Area of Sierra Leone. From 22 January to 16 February 2015, 138 
      participants were enrolled. EVD prevalence was 11.5%. All EVD cases were 
      identified by a positive RDT with a test line score of 6 or more, giving a 
      sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval (CI): 78.2-100). The corresponding 
      specificity was high (96.6%, 95% CI: 91.3-99.1). The positive and negative 
      predictive values for the population prevalence were 79.0% (95% CI: 54.4-93.8) 
      and 100% (95% CI: 96.7-100), respectively. These results, if confirmed in a 
      larger study, suggest that this RDT could be used as a 'rule-out' screening test 
      for EVD to improve rapid case identification and resource allocation.

AB  - Surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors can rapidly detect Ebola antigens at the 
      point-of-care without the need for added reagents, sample processing, or 
      specialized personnel. This preliminary study demonstrates SAW biosensor 
      detection of the Ebola virus in a concentration-dependent manner. The detection 
      limit with this methodology is below the average level of viremia detected on the 
      first day of symptoms by PCR. We observe a log-linear sensor response for highly 
      fragmented Ebola viral particles, with a detection limit corresponding to 1.9 x 
      104 PFU/mL prior to virus inactivation. We predict greatly improved sensitivity 
      for intact, infectious Ebola virus. This point-of-care methodology has the 
      potential to detect Ebola viremia prior to symptom onset, greatly enabling 
      infection control and rapid treatment. This biosensor platform is powered by 
      disposable AA batteries and can be rapidly adapted to detect other emerging 
      diseases in austere conditions.

      suspected ebola cases in the Brong Ahafo Region, Ghana.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study assessed the quality, core and support functions of the 
      integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR) system relating to 18 
      suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Brong Ahafo Region, Ghana. 
      METHODS: Data was collected on selected indicators of the surveillance system 
      relating to 18 suspected cases of EVD, from epidemiological week 19 to 45 of 
      2014. We conducted in-depth interviews with seven medical directors and two 
      district directors of health services, and also reviewed documentation on the 
      implementation of the core, support and quality functions of the IDSR system. We 
      also monitored news in the media and rumours about EVD within the community as 
      well as in health facility surveillance registers. RESULTS: The study identified 
      gaps in the implementation of IDSR relating to 18 suspected cases of EVD. Health 
      staff heavily relied on haemorrhage as the only symptom for detection of 
      suspected EVD cases. Twelve blood samples and a swab of secretions from the mouth 
      of the thirteenth patient (who died) tested negative for EVD using PCR assay in 
      laboratory confirmation. The blood samples of three patients were discarded, as 
      they did not fit the case definition for suspected cases, whilst two refused for 
      their blood samples to be taken. The community-based surveillance (CBS) system 
      has not been given a prominent role in EVD surveillance and response, as 
      demonstrated by CBS volunteers and health staff not receiving any training in 
      these processes. There was intense public interest in EVD in August and September 
      2014. That interest has since waned for reasons that have to be formally 
      ascertained. Unfounded fear of and anxiety about EVD still remain challenges due 
      to a lack of in-depth knowledge about the disease in Ghana. CONCLUSION: Ghana has 
      been one of the pioneers in the implementation of IDSR in Africa. Despite this, 
      gaps have been identified in the implementation of IDSR relating to EVD in the 
      Brong Ahafo Region. To address these gaps, the CBS system has to actively partner 
      with health facility surveillance to achieve effective IDSR in the region.

AB  - We performed a longitudinal analysis of plasma samples obtained from 4 patients 
      with Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) to determine the relationship between the 
      real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 
      (qRT-PCR)-based threshold cycle (Ct) value and the presence of infectious EBOV. 
      EBOV was not isolated from plasma samples with a Ct value of >35.5 or >12 days 
      after onset of symptoms. EBOV was not isolated from plasma samples in which 
      anti-EBOV nucleoprotein immunoglobulin G was detected. These data demonstrate the 
      utility of interpreting qRT-PCR results in the context of the course of EBOV 
      infection and associated serological responses for patient-management decisions.

TI  - Different Temporal Effects of Ebola Virus VP35 and VP24 Proteins on Global Gene 
      Expression in Human Dendritic Cells.
PG  - 7567-83
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00924-15 [doi]
AB  - Ebola virus (EBOV) causes a severe hemorrhagic fever with a deficient immune 
      response, lymphopenia, and lymphocyte apoptosis. Dendritic cells (DC), which 
      trigger the adaptive response, do not mature despite EBOV infection. We recently 
      demonstrated that DC maturation is unblocked by disabling the innate response 
      antagonizing domains (IRADs) in EBOV VP35 and VP24 by the mutations R312A and 
      K142A, respectively. Here we analyzed the effects of VP35 and VP24 with the IRADs 
      disabled on global gene expression in human DC. Human monocyte-derived DC were 
      infected by wild-type (wt) EBOV or EBOVs carrying the mutation in VP35 
      (EBOV/VP35m), VP24 (EBOV/VP24m), or both (EBOV/VP35m/VP24m). Global gene 
      expression at 8 and 24 h was analyzed by deep sequencing, and the expression of 
      interferon (IFN) subtypes up to 5 days postinfection was analyzed by quantitative 
      reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). wt EBOV induced a weak global gene 
      expression response, including markers of DC maturation, cytokines, chemokines, 
      chemokine receptors, and multiple IFNs. The VP35 mutation unblocked the 
      expression, resulting in a dramatic increase in expression of these transcripts 
      at 8 and 24 h. Surprisingly, DC infected with EBOV/VP24m expressed lower levels 
      of many of these transcripts at 8 h after infection, compared to wt EBOV. In 
      contrast, at 24 h, expression of the transcripts increased in DC infected with 
      any of the three mutants, compared to wt EBOV. Moreover, sets of genes affected 
      by the two mutations only partially overlapped. Pathway analysis demonstrated 
      that the VP35 mutation unblocked pathways involved in antigen processing and 
      presentation and IFN signaling. These data suggest that EBOV IRADs have profound 
      effects on the host adaptive immune response through massive transcriptional 
      downregulation of DC. IMPORTANCE: This study shows that infection of DC with 
      EBOV, but not its mutant forms with the VP35 IRAD and/or VP24 IRAD disabled, 
      causes a global block in expression of host genes. The temporal effects of 
      mutations disrupting the two IRADs differ, and the lists of affected genes only 
      partially overlap such that VP35 and VP24 IRADs each have profound effects on 
      antigen presentation by exposed DC. The global modulation of DC gene expression 
      and the resulting lack of their maturation represent a major mechanism by which 
      EBOV disables the T cell response and suggests that these suppressive pathways 
      are a therapeutic target that may unleash the T cell responses during EBOV 
      infection.

AB  - Humans constantly encounter threats from many infectious, zoonotic, and 
      devastating pathogens. Outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 
      bird flu, and swine flu posing pandemic threats have compelled health agencies to 
      follow global preparedness for combating the emerging deadly pathogens. The 
      outbreak in West Africa of highly contagious Ebola viral disease (EVD) that 
      started in Guinea in December 2013, assumed global proportions to become the 
      largest outbreak of EVD and the most prominent international health concern. With 
      fatality rates of nearly 50%-90%, it has claimed, as of 11 April 2015, 10,619 
      human lives out of a total of 25,626 cases reported worldwide. Ebola virus 
      (EBOV), a member of Filoviridae family, is associated with severe, often lethal, 
      hemorrhagic fever disease in humans and animals. The animal hosts, including 
      non-human primates and reservoir hosts (fruit bats), play a significant role in 
      transmission and maintenance of EBOV in nature. Although no approved vaccine for 
      the prevention of EVD currently exists, disease control can be greatly enhanced 
      by timely laboratory confirmation through blood tests using enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
      (RT-PCR). Adherence to strict sanitary and hygienic measures, monitoring and 
      surveillance of EBOV, as well as quarantine checks on international trade, 
      transport, and visitors from affected countries are mandatory to prevent and 
      control the spread of EVD. This review describes the salient properties of EBOV 
      and the development of novel diagnostics, vaccines, and control strategies for 
      this emerging disease of high public health concern and international emergency.

TI  - Field Evaluation of Capillary Blood Samples as a Collection Specimen for the 
      Rapid Diagnosis of Ebola Virus Infection During an Outbreak Emergency.
PG  - 669-75
LID - 10.1093/cid/civ397 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reliable reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
      (RT-PCR)-based diagnosis of Ebola virus infection currently requires a blood 
      sample obtained by intravenous puncture. During the current Ebola outbreak in 
      Guinea, we evaluated the usability of capillary blood samples collected from 
      fingersticks of patients suspected of having Ebola virus disease (EVD) for field 
      diagnostics during an outbreak emergency. METHODS: A total of 120 venous and 
      capillary blood samples were collected from 53 patients admitted to the Ebola 
      Treatment Centre in Gueckedou, Guinea, between July and August 2014. All sample 
      specimens were analyzed by RT-PCR using the RealStar Filovirus Screen RT-PCR Kit 
      1.0 from altona Diagnostics (Germany). We compared samples obtained by 
      venipuncture and those obtained by capillary blood sampling absorbed onto swab 
      devices. RESULTS: The resulting sensitivity and specificity of tests performed 
      with capillary blood samples were 86.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
      71.9%-95.6%; 33/38 patients) and 100% (95% CI, 84.6%-100%; 22/22 patients), 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that capillary blood samples could 
      serve as an alternative to venous blood samples for the diagnosis of EVD in 
      resource-limited settings during a crisis. This can be of particular advantage in 
      cases when venipuncture is difficult to perform-for example, with newborns and 
      infants or when adult patients reject venipuncture for cultural or religious 
      reasons.

AB  - Ebola is an emerging infectious disease caused by a deadly virus belonging to the 
      family Filoviridae, genus Ebolavirus. Based on their geographical distribution, 
      Ebolavirus has been classified into total five species so far, mainly Zaire, 
      Sudan, Tai Forest, Bundibugyo and Reston. It is important to be able to 
      differentiate the Ebolavirus species as they significantly differ in 
      pathogenicity and more than one species can be present in an area. We have 
      developed a one-step step-down RT-PCR detecting all five Ebolavirus species with 
      high sensitivity (1 copy of Ebolavirus DNA, 10 copies of RNA and 320 copies of 
      RNA spiked in 1 ml whole blood). The primers and FRET-probes we designed enabled 
      us to differentiate five Ebolavirus species by distinct Tm (Zaire: flat peaks 
      between 53.0 degrees C and 56.9 degrees C; Sudan: 51.6 degrees C; Reston: flat peaks between 47.5 degrees C and 
      54.9 degrees C; Tai Forest: 52.8 degrees C; Bundibugyo: dual peaks at 48.9 degrees C and 53.5 degrees C), and by 
      different amplicon sizes (Zaire 255 bp, Sudan 211 bp, Reston 192 bp, Tai Forest 
      166 bp, Bundibugyo 146 bp). This one-size-fit-all assay enables the rapid 
      detection and discrimination of the five Ebolavirus species in a single reaction.

AB  - During the 2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, a real-time quantitative 
      polymerase chain reaction was established to detect and identify the Zaire Ebola 
      virus. We describe the use of this assay to screen 315 clinical samples from EVD 
      suspected person in Sierra Leone. The detection rate in blood samples was 77.81% 
      (207/266), and there were relatively higher detection rate (79.32% and 81.42%, 
      respectively) during the first two weeks after onset of symptoms. In the two 
      weeks that followed, the detection rate declined to 66.67% and 25.00%, 
      respectively. There was the highest virus load at the first week and then 
      decreased. The detection rate in swab samples was 89.79% (44/49). This may be 
      benefit from the included patients. 46 of 49 swab samples were collected from 
      died patients. Taken together, the results presented here indicate that the assay 
      specifically and sensitively detects Zaire Ebola virus.

LID - 21131 [pii]
AB  - We determined complete viral genome sequences from three British healthcare 
      workers infected with Ebola virus (EBOV) in Sierra Leone, directly from clinical 
      samples. These sequences closely resemble those previously observed in the 
      current Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa, with glycoprotein and 
      polymerase genes showing the most sequence variation. Our data indicate that 
      current PCR diagnostic assays remain suitable for detection of EBOV in this 
      epidemic and provide confidence for their continued use in diagnosis.

TI  - Evaluation of Signature Erosion in Ebola Virus Due to Genomic Drift and Its 
      Impact on the Performance of Diagnostic Assays.
PG  - 3130-54
LID - 10.3390/v7062763 [doi]
AB  - Genome sequence analyses of the 2014 Ebola Virus (EBOV) isolates revealed a 
      potential problem with the diagnostic assays currently in use; i.e., drifting 
      genomic profiles of the virus may affect the sensitivity or even produce 
      false-negative results. We evaluated signature erosion in ebolavirus molecular 
      assays using an in silico approach and found frequent potential false-negative 
      and false-positive results. We further empirically evaluated many EBOV assays, 
      under real time PCR conditions using EBOV Kikwit (1995) and Makona (2014) RNA 
      templates. These results revealed differences in performance between assays but 
      were comparable between the old and new EBOV templates. Using a whole genome 
      approach and a novel algorithm, termed BioVelocity, we identified new signatures 
      that are unique to each of EBOV, Sudan virus (SUDV), and Reston virus (RESTV). 
      Interestingly, many of the current assay signatures do not fall within these 
      regions, indicating a potential drawback in the past assay design strategies. The 
      new signatures identified in this study may be evaluated with real-time reverse 
      transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) assay development and validation. In addition, we 
      discuss regulatory implications and timely availability to impact a rapidly 
      evolving outbreak using existing but perhaps less than optimal assays versus 
      redesign these assays for addressing genomic changes.

TI  - ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test kit for point-of-care and laboratory-based testing for 
      Ebola virus disease: a field validation study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, diagnosis of Ebola virus disease requires transport of 
      venepuncture blood to field biocontainment laboratories for testing by real-time 
      RT-PCR, resulting in delays that complicate patient care and infection control 
      efforts. Therefore, an urgent need exists for a point-of-care rapid diagnostic 
      test for this disease. In this Article, we report the results of a field 
      validation of the Corgenix ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test kit. METHODS: We performed 
      the rapid diagnostic test on fingerstick blood samples from 106 individuals with 
      suspected Ebola virus disease presenting at two clinical centres in Sierra Leone. 
      Adults and children who were able to provide verbal consent or assent were 
      included; we excluded patients with haemodynamic instability and those who were 
      unable to cooperate with fingerstick or venous blood draw. Two independent 
      readers scored each rapid diagnostic test, with any disagreements resolved by a 
      third. We compared point-of-care rapid diagnostic test results with clinical 
      real-time RT-PCR results (RealStar Filovirus Screen RT-PCR kit 1.0; altona 
      Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) for venepuncture plasma samples tested in a 
      Public Health England field reference laboratory (Port Loko, Sierra Leone). 
      Separately, we performed the rapid diagnostic test (on whole blood) and real-time 
      RT-PCR (on plasma) on 284 specimens in the reference laboratory, which were 
      submitted to the laboratory for testing from many clinical sites in Sierra Leone, 
      including our two clinical centres. FINDINGS: In point-of-care testing, all 28 
      patients who tested positive for Ebola virus disease by RT-PCR were also positive 
      by fingerstick rapid diagnostic test (sensitivity 100% [95% CI 87.7-100]), and 71 
      of 77 patients who tested negative by RT-PCR were also negative by the rapid 
      diagnostic test (specificity 92.2% [95% CI 83.8-97.1]). In laboratory testing, 
      all 45 specimens that tested positive by RT-PCR were also positive by the rapid 
      diagnostic test (sensitivity 100% [95% CI 92.1-100]), and 214 of 232 specimens 
      that tested negative by RT-PCR were also negative by the rapid diagnostic test 
      (specificity 92.2% [88.0-95.3]). The two independent readers agreed about 95.2% 
      of point-of-care and 98.6% of reference laboratory rapid diagnostic test results. 
      Cycle threshold values ranged from 15.9 to 26.3 (mean 22.6 [SD 2.6]) for the 
      PCR-positive point-of-care cohort and from 17.5 to 26.3 (mean 21.5 [2.7]) for the 
      reference laboratory cohort. Six of 16 banked plasma samples from rapid 
      diagnostic test-positive and altona-negative patients were positive by an 
      alternative real-time RT-PCR assay (the Trombley assay); three (17%) of 18 
      samples from individuals who were negative by both the rapid diagnostic test and 
      altona test were also positive by Trombley. INTERPRETATION: The ReEBOV rapid 
      diagnostic test had 100% sensitivity and 92% specificity in both point-of-care 
      and reference laboratory testing in this population (maximum cycle threshold 
      26.3). With two independent readers, the test detected all patients who were 
      positive for Ebola virus by altona real-time RT-PCR; however, this benchmark 
      itself had imperfect sensitivity. FUNDING: Abundance Foundation.

TI  - Comparison of FilmArray and Quantitative Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase PCR for 
      Detection of Zaire Ebolavirus from Contrived and Clinical Specimens.
PG  - 2956-60
LID - 10.1128/JCM.01317-15 [doi]
AB  - Rapid, reliable, and easy-to-use diagnostic assays for detection of Zaire 
      ebolavirus (ZEBOV) are urgently needed. The goal of this study was to examine the 
      agreement among emergency use authorization (EUA) tests for the detection of 
      ZEBOV nucleic acids, including the BioFire FilmArray BioThreat (BT) panel, the 
      FilmArray BT-E panel, and the NP2 and VP40 quantitative real-time reverse 
      transcriptase (qRT) PCR assays from the Centers for Disease Control and 
      Prevention (CDC). Specimens used in this study included whole blood spiked with 
      inactivated ZEBOV at known titers and whole-blood, plasma, and urine clinical 
      specimens collected from persons diagnosed with Ebola virus disease (EVD). The 
      agreement for FilmArray and qRT-PCR results using contrived whole-blood specimens 
      was 100% (6/6 specimens) for each ZEBOV dilution from 4 x 10(7) to 4 x 10(2) 50% 
      tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/ml, as well as the no-virus 
      negative-control sample. The limit of detection for FilmArray and qRT-PCR assays 
      with inactivated ZEBOV, based on duplicate positive results, was determined to be 
      4 x 10(2) TCID50/ml. Rates of agreement between FilmArray and qRT-PCR results for 
      clinical specimens from patients with EVD were 85% (23/27 specimens) for 
      whole-blood specimens, 90% (18/20 specimens) for whole-blood specimens tested by 
      FilmArray testing and matched plasma specimens tested by qRT-PCR testing, and 85% 
      (11/13 specimens) for urine specimens. Among 60 specimens, eight discordant 
      results were noted, with ZEBOV nucleic acids being detected only by FilmArray 
      testing in four specimens and only by qRT-PCR testing in the remaining four 
      specimens. These findings demonstrate that the rapid and easy-to-use FilmArray 
      panels are effective tests for evaluating patients with EVD.

TI  - Lessons learnt from the management of a case of Lassa fever and follow-up of 
      nosocomial primary contacts in Nigeria during Ebola virus disease outbreak in 
      West Africa.
PG  - 1424-1430
LID - 10.1111/tmi.12565 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe our experiences in the management of a case of Lassa fever 
      (LF) and follow-up of nosocomial primary contacts during the 2014 Ebola outbreak 
      in West Africa. METHODS: Clinical management of the index case and infection 
      control/surveillance activities for primary contacts are described. Laboratory 
      confirmation was by Lassa virus-specific reverse-transcriptase PCR. RESULTS: A 
      28-year-old man with a 10-day history of febrile illness was referred to a major 
      tertiary hospital in south-east Nigeria from a city that previously experienced a 
      LF outbreak and was recently affected by Ebola. On observation of haemorrhagic 
      features, clinicians were at a crossroads. Diagnosis of LF was confirmed at a 
      National Reference Centre. The patient died despite initiation of ribavirin 
      therapy. Response activities identified 121 primary contacts comprising 78 
      (64.5%) hospital staff/interns, 19 (15.7%) medical students, 18 (14.9%) 
      inpatients and 6 (5.0%) relatives. Their mean age was 32.8 +/- 6.6 years, and 65.3% 
      were women. Twenty (16.5%) had high-risk exposure and were offered ribavirin as 
      post-exposure prophylaxis. No secondary case of LF occurred. Fatigue (43.8%) and 
      dizziness (31.3%) were the commonest side effects of ribavirin. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Response activities contained nosocomial spread of LF, but challenges were 
      experienced including lack of a purpose-built isolation facility, absence of 
      local Lassa virus laboratory capacity, failure to use appropriate protective 
      equipment and stigmatisation of contacts. A key lesson is that the weak health 
      systems of Africa should be comprehensively strengthened; otherwise, we might win 
      the Ebola battle but lose the one against less virulent infections for which 
      effective treatment exists.

TI  - Buffer AVL Alone Does Not Inactivate Ebola Virus in a Representative Clinical 
      Sample Type.
PG  - 3148-54
LID - 10.1128/JCM.01449-15 [doi]
AB  - Rapid inactivation of Ebola virus (EBOV) is crucial for high-throughput testing 
      of clinical samples in low-resource, outbreak scenarios. The EBOV inactivation 
      efficacy of Buffer AVL (Qiagen) was tested against marmoset serum (EBOV 
      concentration of 1 x 10(8) 50% tissue culture infective dose per milliliter 
      [TCID50 . ml(-1)]) and murine blood (EBOV concentration of 1 x 10(7) TCID50 . 
      ml(-1)) at 4:1 vol/vol buffer/sample ratios. Posttreatment cell culture and 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis indicated that treatment with 
      Buffer AVL did not inactivate EBOV in 67% of samples, indicating that Buffer AVL, 
      which is designed for RNA extraction and not virus inactivation, cannot be 
      guaranteed to inactivate EBOV in diagnostic samples. Murine blood samples treated 
      with ethanol (4:1 [vol/vol] ethanol/sample) or heat (60 degrees C for 15 min) also showed 
      no viral inactivation in 67% or 100% of samples, respectively. However, combined 
      Buffer AVL and ethanol or Buffer AVL and heat treatments showed total viral 
      inactivation in 100% of samples tested. The Buffer AVL plus ethanol and Buffer 
      AVL plus heat treatments were also shown not to affect the extraction of PCR 
      quality RNA from EBOV-spiked murine blood samples.

TI  - Molecular evidence of Ebola Reston virus infection in Philippine bats.
PG  - 107
LID - 10.1186/s12985-015-0331-3 [doi]
LID - 107
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2008-09, evidence of Reston ebolavirus (RESTV) infection was found 
      in domestic pigs and pig workers in the Philippines. With species of bats having 
      been shown to be the cryptic reservoir of filoviruses elsewhere, the Philippine 
      government, in conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
      United Nations, assembled a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional team to 
      investigate Philippine bats as the possible reservoir of RESTV. METHODS: The team 
      undertook surveillance of bat populations at multiple locations during 2010 using 
      both serology and molecular assays. RESULTS: A total of 464 bats from 21 species 
      were sampled. We found both molecular and serologic evidence of RESTV infection 
      in multiple bat species. RNA was detected with quantitative PCR (qPCR) in 
      oropharyngeal swabs taken from Miniopterus schreibersii, with three samples 
      yielding a product on conventional hemi-nested PCR whose sequences differed from 
      a Philippine pig isolate by a single nucleotide. Uncorroborated qPCR detections 
      may indicate RESTV nucleic acid in several additional bat species (M. australis, 
      C. brachyotis and Ch. plicata). We also detected anti-RESTV antibodies in three 
      bats (Acerodon jubatus) using both Western blot and ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      findings suggest that ebolavirus infection is taxonomically widespread in 
      Philippine bats, but the evident low prevalence and low viral load warrants 
      expanded surveillance to elaborate the findings, and more broadly, to determine 
      the taxonomic and geographic occurrence of ebolaviruses in bats in the region.

TI  - Clinical features of patients isolated for suspected Ebola virus disease at 
      Connaught Hospital, Freetown, Sierra Leone: a retrospective cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The size of the west African Ebola virus disease outbreak led to the 
      urgent establishment of Ebola holding unit facilities for isolation and 
      diagnostic testing of patients with suspected Ebola virus disease. Following the 
      onset of the outbreak in Sierra Leone, patients presenting to Connaught Hospital 
      in Freetown were screened for suspected Ebola virus disease on arrival and, if 
      necessary, were admitted to the on-site Ebola holding unit. Since demand for beds 
      in this unit greatly exceeded capacity, we aimed to improve the selection of 
      patients with suspected Ebola virus disease for admission by identifying 
      presenting clinical characteristics that were predictive of a confirmed 
      diagnosis. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we recorded the 
      presenting clinical characteristics of suspected Ebola virus disease cases 
      admitted to Connaught Hospital's Ebola holding unit. Patients were subsequently 
      classified as confirmed Ebola virus disease cases or non-cases according to the 
      result of Ebola virus reverse-transcriptase PCR (EBOV RT-PCR) testing. The 
      sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, 
      and likelihood ratio of every clinical characteristic were calculated, to 
      estimate the diagnostic accuracy and predictive value of each clinical 
      characteristic for confirmed Ebola virus disease. RESULTS: Between May 29, 2014, 
      and Dec 8, 2014, 850 patients with suspected Ebola virus disease were admitted to 
      the holding unit, of whom 724 had an EBOV RT-PCR result recorded and were 
      included in the analysis. In 464 (64%) of these patients, a diagnosis of Ebola 
      virus disease was confirmed. Fever or history of fever (n=599, 83%), intense 
      fatigue or weakness (n=495, 68%), vomiting or nausea (n=365, 50%), and diarrhoea 
      (n=294, 41%) were the most common presenting symptoms in suspected cases. 
      Presentation with intense fatigue, confusion, conjunctivitis, hiccups, diarrhea, 
      or vomiting was associated with increased likelihood of confirmed Ebola virus 
      disease. Three or more of these symptoms in combination increased the probability 
      of Ebola virus disease by 3.2-fold (95% CI 2.3-4.4), but the sensitivity of this 
      strategy for Ebola virus disease diagnosis was low. In a subgroup analysis, 15 
      (9%) of 161 confirmed Ebola virus disease cases reported neither a history of 
      fever nor a risk factor for Ebola virus disease exposure. INTERPRETATION: 
      Discrimination of Ebola virus disease cases from patients without the disease is 
      a major challenge in an outbreak and needs rapid diagnostic testing. Suspected 
      Ebola virus disease case definitions that rely on history of fever and risk 
      factors for Ebola virus disease exposure do not have sufficient sensitivity to 
      identify all cases of the disease. FUNDING: None.

AB  - This article sought to analyze the clinical features of 154 patients suspected of 
      having Ebola virus disease (EVD) in an Ebola holding center in Sierra Leone from 
      October 1 through November 9, 2014. We found that 108 of the 154 patients were 
      confirmed with EVD. Eighty-five had known outcomes. Forty-nine of the 85 patients 
      had been exposed to EVD. The average mortality rate was 60%. The mean interval 
      between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization was 5.8 +/- 3.3 days. The mean 
      incubation period was 9.2 +/- 6.7 days. Common symptoms of the EVD patients on 
      admission were fatigue (85.2%), anorexia (84.3%), fever (75.9%), and headache 
      (72.2%). Our data showed that the total symptoms of confirmed EVD patients were 
      significantly higher than those of non-EVD patients (9 vs. 5.5; p < 0.001). The 
      likelihood of EVD was 87.6% when a patient presented more than 6 out of 21 
      symptoms on admission. The survivors were significantly younger than 
      non-survivors (24.0 +/- 10.0 years vs. 31.3 +/- 15.3 years; p = 0.016). The real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed that, in the survivors, the virus 
      load was significantly lower (Ct value: 25.2 +/- 4.1 vs. 28.7 +/- 5.7; p = 0.002). 
      Multivariate analysis showed that age, fever, and viral load were independent 
      predictors of mortality. Taken together, our data suggested that a cutoff of six 
      symptoms could be used to predict patients with high or low risk of EVD. It 
      seemed that age, fever, and viral load were the main risk factors associated with 
      EVD mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical management of Ebola virus disease remains challenging. 
      Routine laboratory analytics are often unavailable in the outbreak setting, and 
      few data exist for the associated haematological and biochemical abnormalities. 
      We aimed to assess laboratory and clinical data from patients with Ebola virus 
      disease to better inform clinical management algorithms, improve understanding of 
      key variables associated with outcome, and provide insight into the 
      pathophysiology of Ebola virus disease. METHODS: We recruited all patients, alive 
      on arrival, with confirmed Ebola virus disease who were admitted to the Kerry 
      Town Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone. At admission, all patients had 
      clinical presentation recorded and blood taken for Ebola confirmation using 
      reverse-transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and for haematological and biochemical 
      analysis. We studied the association between these and clinical outcome. The 
      primary outcome was discharge from the Ebola treatment centre. FINDINGS: 150 
      patients were admitted to the treatment centre between Dec 8, 2014, and Jan 9, 
      2015. The mean age of patients was 26 years (SD 14.7). Case fatality rate was 37% 
      (55/150). Most patients presented with stage 2 (gastrointestinal involvement, 
      72/118 [61%]) and stage 3 (severe or complicated, 12/118 [10%]) disease. Acute 
      kidney injury was common (52/104 [50%]), as were abnormal serum potassium (32/97 
      [33%]), severe hepatitis (54/92 [59%]), and raised C-reactive protein (21/100 
      [21%]). Haematological abnormalities were common, including raised haematocrit 
      (15/100 [15%]), thrombocytopenia (47/104 [45%]), and granulocytosis (44/104 
      [42%]). Severe acute kidney injury, low RT-PCR cycle threshold (<20 cycles), and 
      severe hepatitis were independently associated with mortality. INTERPRETATION: 
      Ebola virus disease is associated with a high prevalence of haematological and 
      biochemical abnormalities, even in mild disease and in the absence of 
      gastrointestinal symptoms. Clinical care that targets hypovolaemia, electrolyte 
      disturbance, and acute kidney injury is likely to reduce historically high case 
      fatality rates. FUNDING: None.

AB  - In October 2014, a health-care worker who had been part of the treatment team for 
      the first laboratory-confirmed case of Ebola virus disease imported to the United 
      States developed symptoms of Ebola virus disease. A presumptive positive reverse 
      transcription PCR assay result for Ebola virus RNA in a blood sample from the 
      worker was confirmed by the CDC, making this the first documented occurrence of 
      domestic transmission of Ebola virus in the United States. The Texas Department 
      of State Health Services commissioner issued a control order requiring 
      disinfection and decontamination of the health-care worker's residence. This 
      process was delayed until the patient's pet dog (which, having been exposed to a 
      human with Ebola virus disease, potentially posed a public health risk) was 
      removed from the residence. This report describes the movement, quarantine, care, 
      testing, and release of the pet dog, highlighting the interdisciplinary, 
      one-health approach and extensive collaboration and communication across local, 
      county, state, and federal agencies involved in the response.

AB  - Ebola outbreak-2014 (mainly Zaire strain related Ebola virus) has been declared 
      most widely spread deadly persistent epidemic due to unavailability of rapid 
      diagnostic, detection, and therapeutics. Ebola virus disease (EVD), a severe 
      viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome caused by Ebola virus (EBOV) is transmitted by 
      direct contact with the body fluids of infected person and objects contaminated 
      with virus or infected animals. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared EVD 
      epidemic as public health emergency of international concern with severe global 
      economic burden. At fatal EBOV infection stage, patients usually die before the 
      antibody response. Currently, rapid blood tests to diagnose EBOV infection 
      include the antigen or antibodies capture using ELISA and RNA detection using 
      RT/Q-PCR within 3-10 days after the onset of symptoms. Moreover, few 
      nanotechnology-based colorimetric and paper-based immunoassay methods have been 
      recently reported to detect Ebola virus. Unfortunately, these methods are limited 
      to laboratory only. As state-of-the art (SoA) diagnostics time to confirm Ebola 
      infection, varies from 6h to about 3 days, it causes delay in therapeutic 
      approaches. Thus developing a cost-effective, rapid, sensitive, and selective 
      sensor to detect EVD at point-of-care (POC) is certainly worth exploring to 
      establish rapid diagnostics to decide therapeutics. This review highlights SoA of 
      Ebola diagnostics and also a call to develop rapid, selective and sensitive POC 
      detection of EBOV for global health care. We propose that adopting miniaturized 
      electrochemical EBOV immunosensing can detect virus level at pM concentration 
      within  approximately 40min compared to 3 days of ELISA test at nM levels.

AB  - Sexual transmission of Ebola virus in Liberia has now been documented and 
      associated with new clusters in regions previously declared Ebola free. Assays 
      that have Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and are routinely used to detect 
      Ebola virus RNA in whole blood and plasma specimens at the Liberian Institute for 
      Biomedical Research were tested for their suitability in detecting the presence 
      of Ebola virus RNA in semen. Qiagen AVL extraction protocols, as well as the 
      Ebola Zaire Target 1 and major groove binder quantitative reverse-transcription 
      polymerase chain reaction assays, were demonstrably suitable for this purpose and 
      should facilitate epidemiologic investigations, including those involving 
      long-term survivors of Ebola.

AB  - CDC designated category A infectious agents pose a major risk to national 
      security and require special action for public health preparedness. They include 
      viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) syndrome as well as variola 
      virus, the agent of smallpox. VHF is characterized by hemorrhage and fever with 
      multi-organ failure leading to high morbidity and mortality. Smallpox, a prior 
      scourge, has been eradicated for decades, making it a particularly serious threat 
      if released nefariously in the essentially non-immune world population. Early 
      detection of the causative agents, and the ability to distinguish them from other 
      pathogens, is essential to contain outbreaks, implement proper control measures, 
      and prevent morbidity and mortality. We have developed a multiplex detection 
      assay that uses several species-specific PCR primers to generate amplicons from 
      multiple pathogens; these are then targeted in a ligase detection reaction (LDR). 
      The resultant fluorescently-labeled ligation products are detected on a universal 
      array enabling simultaneous identification of the pathogens. The assay was 
      evaluated on 32 different isolates associated with VHF (ebolavirus, marburgvirus, 
      Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Lassa fever virus, Rift Valley fever 
      virus, Dengue virus, and Yellow fever virus) as well as variola virus and 
      vaccinia virus (the agent of smallpox and its vaccine strain, respectively). The 
      assay was able to detect all viruses tested, including 8 sequences representative 
      of different variola virus strains from the CDC repository. It does not cross 
      react with other emerging zoonoses such as monkeypox virus or cowpox virus, or 
      six flaviviruses tested (St. Louis encephalitis virus, Murray Valley encephalitis 
      virus, Powassan virus, Tick-borne encephalitis virus, West Nile virus and 
      Japanese encephalitis virus).

AB  - The massive outbreak of highly lethal Ebola hemorrhagic fever in West Africa 
      illustrates the urgent need for diagnostic instruments that can identify and 
      quantify infections rapidly, accurately, and with low complexity. Here, we report 
      on-chip sample preparation, amplification-free detection and quantification of 
      Ebola virus on clinical samples using hybrid optofluidic integration. Sample 
      preparation and target preconcentration are implemented on a PDMS-based 
      microfluidic chip (automaton), followed by single nucleic acid fluorescence 
      detection in liquid-core optical waveguides on a silicon chip in under ten 
      minutes. We demonstrate excellent specificity, a limit of detection of 0.2 pfu/mL 
      and a dynamic range of thirteen orders of magnitude, far outperforming other 
      amplification-free methods. This chip-scale approach and reduced complexity 
      compared to gold standard RT-PCR methods is ideal for portable instruments that 
      can provide immediate diagnosis and continued monitoring of infectious diseases 
      at the point-of-care.

AB  - Several Chinese commercial real-time PCR kits for Zaire ebolavirus have been 
      developed after the Ebola outbreak and used by Chinese medical teams in West 
      Africa. In order to know the essential performance indicators of these kits, 
      analytical sensitivity and precision were evaluated with virus-like particle 
      (VLP)-encapsulated EBOV RNA. The limit of detection (LOD) and the precision were 
      completed with a series of VLPs. The maximum and minimum of LOD was acquired by 
      ZJ BioTech and Daan gene, respectively. For precision, all of the detection 
      results were <5% except the maximum 5.17%. Among them, Puruikang, Daan gene, 
      Sansure, ZJ BioTech, and Huada demonstrated superior reproducibility. Overall, 
      the requirements of LOD <1000 copies/mL and coefficient of variation <5% could be 
      satisfied by all kits except Kehua. Meanwhile, it is feasible for VLPs as a 
      substitute of positive samples in assay evaluation.

AB  - The Ebola virus, which became a global health concern in 2014, is an example of 
      an emerging pathogen. Ebola virus disease can only be diagnosed in biosafety 
      level 3 and 4 laboratories, which provide the security required to avoid exposure 
      of both the staff and the environment to the pathogen. These laboratories are 
      often far from the site of outbreaks, which may occur in rural areas or border 
      regions (when the disease is imported from a neighboring country). Rapidly 
      deployable laboratory units can bring the diagnosis closer to the outbreak site 
      and thus significantly shorten the time to delivery of results, thus facilitating 
      epidemic containment. Here we report our experience from the first months of 
      implementation in Mali of a mobile laboratory unit of the same type as the 
      European mobile labs and we describe the workflow in the laboratory as well as 
      the training of its Malian staff. Based on our experience and the reports of 
      other projects, we propose a framework in which these mobile laboratory units can 
      strengthen epidemiological surveillance and contribute to containing outbreaks of 
      emerging diseases in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ebola virus has been detected in the semen of men after their 
      recovery from Ebola virus disease (EVD). We report the presence of Ebola virus 
      RNA in semen in a cohort of survivors of EVD in Sierra Leone. METHODS: We 
      enrolled a convenience sample of 220 adult male survivors of EVD in Sierra Leone, 
      at various times after discharge from an Ebola treatment unit (ETU), in two 
      phases (100 participants were in phase 1, and 120 in phase 2). Semen specimens 
      obtained at baseline were tested by means of a quantitative 
      reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay with the use of 
      the target sequences of NP and VP40 (in phase 1) or NP and GP (in phase 2). This 
      study did not evaluate directly the risk of sexual transmission of EVD. RESULTS: 
      Of 210 participants who provided an initial semen specimen for analysis, 57 (27%) 
      had positive results on quantitative RT-PCR. Ebola virus RNA was detected in the 
      semen of all 7 men with a specimen obtained within 3 months after ETU discharge, 
      in 26 of 42 (62%) with a specimen obtained at 4 to 6 months, in 15 of 60 (25%) 
      with a specimen obtained at 7 to 9 months, in 4 of 26 (15%) with a specimen 
      obtained at 10 to 12 months, in 4 of 38 (11%) with a specimen obtained at 13 to 
      15 months, in 1 of 25 (4%) with a specimen obtained at 16 to 18 months, and in no 
      men with a specimen obtained at 19 months or later. Among the 46 participants 
      with a positive result in phase 1, the median baseline cycle-threshold values 
      (higher values indicate lower RNA values) for the NP and VP40 targets were lower 
      within 3 months after ETU discharge (32.4 and 31.3, respectively; in 7 men) than 
      at 4 to 6 months (34.3 and 33.1; in 25), at 7 to 9 months (37.4 and 36.6; in 13), 
      and at 10 to 12 months (37.7 and 36.9; in 1). In phase 2, a total of 11 
      participants had positive results for NP and GP targets (samples obtained at 4.1 
      to 15.7 months after ETU discharge); cycle-threshold values ranged from 32.7 to 
      38.0 for NP and from 31.1 to 37.7 for GP. CONCLUSIONS: These data showed the 
      long-term presence of Ebola virus RNA in semen and declining persistence with 
      increasing time after ETU discharge. (Funded by the World Health Organization and 
      others.).

TI  - [Real-time PCR Detection Method for the Reston Subtype of the Ebola Virus].
PG  - 276-81
AB  - We aimed to develop a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection method 
      for the Reston subtype of the Ebola virus. The NP gene of the Reston subtype of 
      the Ebola virus was selected as the detection object. Sequences of different 
      subtypes of Ebola viruses were aligned using Clustal W software. The most unique 
      and conserved regions of the Reston subtype of the Ebola virus were recruited as 
      candidate sequences for specific primers. Primer Express and Primer Premier 5. 0 
      software were used to filter the optimal pair of primers for detection. Real-time 
      PCR was carried out using optimized parameters and positive DNA prepared by 
      serial (tenfold) dilution of a recombinant plasmid and by plotting a standard 
      curve. In addition, the reproducibility, accuracy, and specificity of the assay 
      were tested. Results showed that the sensitivity of detection of the Reston 
      subtype of the Ebola virus by real-time PCR could reached 10(2) copies/microL. 
      The linear relationship (R2) reached 0.997, the slope of the standard curve was 
      -0.3101, and amplification efficiency was 110.145%. A sharp and narrow melting 
      peak appeared at 79.94 degrees C for all standards in different dilutions. In 
      conclusion, a fast and sensitive real-time PCR detection system for the Reston 
      subtype of the Ebola virus was developed. This system could be used as a 
      supplementary diagnostic and monitoring approach for basic and clinical studies 
      on the Reston subtype of the Ebola virus. The detection system does not require 
      expensive technology or specialist operators.

TI  - Development of an antibody capture ELISA using inactivated Ebola Zaire Makona 
      virus.
PG  - 173-83
LID - 10.1007/s00430-015-0438-6 [doi]
AB  - The 2014 Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV) outbreak in West Africa represents an 
      international public health concern. Highly sensitive and precise diagnostic 
      tools are needed. In the present study, we developed a ZEBOV-specific 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using inactivated ZEBOV isolate Makona 
      from March 2014. Mock antigen was used to address nonspecific binding. 
      Specificity, reproducibility and precision were determined to measure assay 
      performance. The ZEBOV ELISA proved to be specific (96 %), reproducible and 
      precise (Intra-assay CV 8 %, Inter-assay CV 18 %). Using the human monoclonal 
      antibody KZ52, we showed that the ELISA was able to detect conformation-specific 
      antibodies. Monitoring antibody development in 29 PCR-positive EBOV disease (EVD) 
      patients revealed seroconversion in all cases. In addition, the ELISA was used to 
      detect ZEBOV glycoprotein (GP)-specific antibodies in a vaccinated volunteer from 
      day 14 until 5 years post-vaccination with a VSV-ZEBOV candidate vaccine. The 
      results demonstrate the high reproducibility, specificity and sensitivity of this 
      newly developed ELISA, which is suitable for the detection of specific antibody 
      responses directed against different ZEBOV proteins in EVD patients and against 
      the ZEBOV surface glycoprotein GP in vaccinated individuals.

AB  - During 2014-2015, an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) swept across parts of 
      West Africa. The China Mobile Laboratory Testing Team was dispatched to support 
      response efforts; during September 28-November 11, 2014, they conducted PCR 
      testing on samples from 1,635 suspected EVD patients. Of those patients, 50.4% 
      were positive, of whom 84.6% lived within a 3-km zone along main roads connecting 
      rural towns and densely populated cities. The median time from symptom onset to 
      testing was 5 days. At testing, 75.7% of the confirmed patients had fever, and 
      94.1% reported at least 1 gastrointestinal symptom; all symptoms, except rash and 
      hemorrhage, were more frequent in confirmed than nonconfirmed patients. Virus 
      loads were significantly higher in EVD patients with fever, diarrhea, fatigue, or 
      headache. The case-fatality rate was lower among patients 15-44 years of age and 
      with virus loads of <100,000 RNA copies/mL. These findings are key for optimizing 
      EVD control and treatment measures.

TI  - Development of a TaqMan Array Card for Acute-Febrile-Illness Outbreak 
      Investigation and Surveillance of Emerging Pathogens, Including Ebola Virus.
PG  - 49-58
LID - 10.1128/JCM.02257-15 [doi]
AB  - Acute febrile illness (AFI) is associated with substantial morbidity and 
      mortality worldwide, yet an etiologic agent is often not identified. 
      Convalescent-phase serology is impractical, blood culture is slow, and many 
      pathogens are fastidious or impossible to cultivate. We developed a real-time 
      PCR-based TaqMan array card (TAC) that can test six to eight samples within 2.5 h 
      from sample to results and can simultaneously detect 26 AFI-associated organisms, 
      including 15 viruses (chikungunya, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] virus, 
      dengue, Ebola virus, Bundibugyo virus, Sudan virus, hantaviruses [Hantaan and 
      Seoul], hepatitis E, Marburg, Nipah virus, o'nyong-nyong virus, Rift Valley fever 
      virus, West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus), 8 bacteria (Bartonella spp., 
      Brucella spp., Coxiella burnetii, Leptospira spp., Rickettsia spp., Salmonella 
      enterica and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, and Yersinia pestis), and 3 
      protozoa (Leishmania spp., Plasmodium spp., and Trypanosoma brucei). Two 
      extrinsic controls (phocine herpesvirus 1 and bacteriophage MS2) were included to 
      ensure extraction and amplification efficiency. Analytical validation was 
      performed on spiked specimens for linearity, intra-assay precision, interassay 
      precision, limit of detection, and specificity. The performance of the card on 
      clinical specimens was evaluated with 1,050 blood samples by comparison to the 
      individual real-time PCR assays, and the TAC exhibited an overall 88% (278/315; 
      95% confidence interval [CI], 84% to 92%) sensitivity and a 99% (5,261/5,326, 98% 
      to 99%) specificity. This TaqMan array card can be used in field settings as a 
      rapid screen for outbreak investigation or for the surveillance of pathogens, 
      including Ebola virus.

AB  - Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is the 
      most sensitive quantitative diagnostic assay for detection of Ebola virus in 
      multiple body fluids. Despite the strengths of this assay, we present 2 cases of 
      Ebola virus disease (EVD) and highlight the potential for false-negative results 
      during the early and late stages of EVD. The first case emphasizes the low 
      negative-predictive value of qRT-PCR during incubation and the early febrile 
      stage of EVD, and the second case emphasizes the potential for false-negative 
      results during recovery and late neurologic complications of EVD. Careful 
      interpretation of test results are needed to guide difficult admission and 
      discharge decisions in suspected or confirmed EVD.

TI  - Evaluation of the Biofire FilmArray BioThreat-E Test (v2.5) for Rapid 
      Identification of Ebola Virus Disease in Heat-Treated Blood Samples Obtained in 
      Sierra Leone and the United Kingdom.
PG  - 114-9
LID - 10.1128/JCM.02287-15 [doi]
AB  - Rapid Ebola virus (EBOV) detection is crucial for appropriate patient management 
      and care. The performance of the FilmArray BioThreat-E test (v2.5) using 
      whole-blood samples was evaluated in Sierra Leone and the United Kingdom and was 
      compared with results generated by a real-time Ebola Zaire PCR reference method. 
      Samples were tested in diagnostic laboratories upon availability, included 
      successive samples from individual patients, and were heat treated to facilitate 
      EBOV inactivation prior to PCR. The BioThreat-E test had a sensitivity of 84% 
      (confidence interval [CI], 64% to 95%) and a specificity of 89% (CI, 73% to 97%) 
      in Sierra Leone (n = 60; 44 patients) and a sensitivity of 75% (CI, 19% to 99%) 
      and a specificity of 100% (CI, 97% to 100%) in the United Kingdom (n = 108; 70 
      patients) compared to the reference real-time PCR. Statistical analysis (Fisher's 
      exact test) indicated there was no significant difference between the methods at 
      the 99% confidence level in either country. In 9 discrepant results (5 real-time 
      PCR positives and BioThreat-E test negatives and 4 real-time PCR negatives and 
      BioThreat-E test positives), the majority (n = 8) were obtained from samples with 
      an observed or probable low viral load. The FilmArray BioThreat-E test (v2.5) 
      therefore provides an attractive option for laboratories (either in austere field 
      settings or in countries with an advanced technological infrastructure) which do 
      not routinely offer an EBOV diagnostic capability.

TI  - Ebola viral load at diagnosis associates with patient outcome and outbreak 
      evolution.
PG  - 4421-8
LID - 83162 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI83162 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ebola virus (EBOV) causes periodic outbreaks of life-threatening EBOV 
      disease in Africa. Historically, these outbreaks have been relatively small and 
      geographically contained; however, the magnitude of the EBOV outbreak that began 
      in 2014 in West Africa has been unprecedented. The aim of this study was to 
      describe the viral kinetics of EBOV during this outbreak and identify factors 
      that contribute to outbreak progression. METHODS: From July to December 2014, one 
      laboratory in Sierra Leone processed over 2,700 patient samples for EBOV 
      detection by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Viremia was measured following patient 
      admission. Age, sex, and approximate time of symptom onset were also recorded for 
      each patient. The data was analyzed using various mathematical models to find 
      trends of potential interest. RESULTS: The analysis revealed a significant 
      difference (P = 2.7 x 10(-77)) between the initial viremia of survivors (4.02 
      log10 genome equivalents [GEQ]/ml) and nonsurvivors (6.18 log10 GEQ/ml). At the 
      population level, patient viral loads were higher on average in July than in 
      November, even when accounting for outcome and time since onset of symptoms. This 
      decrease in viral loads temporally correlated with an increase in circulating 
      EBOV-specific IgG antibodies among individuals who were suspected of being 
      infected but shown to be negative for the virus by PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      indicate that initial viremia is associated with outcome of the individual and 
      outbreak duration; therefore, care must be taken in planning clinical trials and 
      interventions. Additional research in virus adaptation and the impacts of host 
      factors on EBOV transmission and pathogenesis is needed.

AB  - In the absence of a vaccine or specific treatments for Ebola virus disease (EVD), 
      early identification of cases is crucial for the control of EVD epidemics. We 
      evaluated a new extraction kit (SpeedXtract (SE), Qiagen) on sera and swabs in 
      combination with an improved diagnostic reverse transcription recombinase 
      polymerase amplification assay for the detection of Ebola virus (EBOV-RT-RPA). 
      The performance of combined extraction and detection was best for swabs. 
      Sensitivity and specificity of the combined SE and EBOV-RT-RPA were tested in a 
      mobile laboratory consisting of a mobile glovebox and a Diagnostics-in-a-Suitcase 
      powered by a battery and solar panel, deployed to Matoto Conakry, Guinea as part 
      of the reinforced surveillance strategy in April 2015 to reach the goal of zero 
      cases. The EBOV-RT-RPA was evaluated in comparison to two real-time PCR assays. 
      Of 928 post-mortem swabs, 120 tested positive, and the combined SE and 
      EBOV-RT-RPA yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 100% in reference to one 
      real-time RT-PCR assay. Another widely used real-time RT-PCR was much less 
      sensitive than expected. Results were provided very fast within 30 to 60 min, and 
      the field deployment of the mobile laboratory helped improve burial management 
      and community engagement.

AB  - The 2013-present Ebola virus outbreak in Western Africa has prompted the 
      production of many diagnostic assays, mostly based on nucleic acid amplification 
      technologies (NAT). The calibration and performance assessment of established 
      assays and those under evaluation requires reference materials that can be used 
      in parallel with the clinical sample to standardise or control for every step of 
      the procedure, from extraction to the final qualitative/quantitative result. We 
      have developed safe and stable Ebola virus RNA reference materials by 
      encapsidating anti sense viral RNA into HIV-1-like particles. The lentiviral 
      particles are replication-deficient and non-infectious due to the lack of HIV-1 
      genes and Envelope protein. Ebola virus genes were subcloned for encapsidation 
      into two lentiviral preparations, one containing NP-VP35-GP and the other VP40 
      and L RNA. Each reference material was formulated as a high-titre standard for 
      use as a calibrator for secondary or internal standards, and a 10,000-fold lower 
      titre preparation to serve as an in-run control. The preparations have been 
      freeze-dried to maximise stability. These HIV-Ebola virus RNA reference materials 
      were suitable for use with in-house and commercial quantitative RT-PCR assays and 
      with digital RT-PCR. The HIV-Ebola virus RNA reference materials are stable at up 
      to 37 degrees C for two weeks, allowing the shipment of the material worldwide at ambient 
      temperature. These results support further evaluation of the HIV-Ebola virus RNA 
      reference materials as part of an International collaborative study for the 
      establishment of the 1st International Standard for Ebola virus RNA.

AB  - Recent outbreaks of deadly infectious diseases, such as Ebola and Middle East 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus, have motivated the research for accurate, rapid 
      diagnostics that can be administered at the point of care. Nucleic acid 
      biomarkers for these diseases can be amplified and quantified via polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR). In order to solve the problems of conventional PCR--speed, 
      uniform heating and cooling, and massive metal heating blocks--an innovative 
      optofluidic cavity PCR method using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is accomplished. 
      Using this device, 30 thermal cycles between 94  degrees C and 68  degrees C can be accomplished 
      in 4 min for 1.3 muL (10 min for 10 muL). Simulation results show that temperature 
      differences across the 750 mum thick cavity are less than 2  degrees C and 0.2  degrees C, 
      respectively, at 94  degrees C and 68  degrees C. Nucleic acid concentrations as low as 10(-8) ng 
      muL(-1) (2 DNA copies per muL) can be amplified with 40 PCR thermal cycles. This 
      simple, ultrafast, precise, robust, and low-cost optofluidic cavity PCR is 
      favorable for advanced molecular diagnostics and precision medicine. It is 
      especially important for the development of lightweight, point-of-care devices 
      for use in both developing and developed countries.

AB  - In early February 2014, an outbreak of the Ebola virus disease caused by Zaire 
      ebolavirus (EBOV) occurred in Guinea; cases were also recorded in other West 
      African countries with a combined population of approximately 25 million. A 
      rapid, sensitive and inexpensive method for detecting EBOV is needed to 
      effectively control such outbreak. Here, we report a real-time 
      reverse-transcription PCR assay for Z. ebolavirus detection used by the 
      Specialized Anti-epidemic Team of the Russian Federation during the Ebola virus 
      disease prevention mission in the Republic of Guinea. The analytical sensitivity 
      of the assay is 5 x 10(2) viral particles per ml, and high specificity is 
      demonstrated using representative sampling of viral, bacterial and human nucleic 
      acids. This assay can be applied successfully for detecting the West African 
      strains of Z. ebolavirus as well as on strains isolated in the Democratic 
      Republic of the Congo in 2014.

TI  - Use of Viremia to Evaluate the Baseline Case Fatality Ratio of Ebola Virus 
      Disease and Inform Treatment Studies: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
PG  - e1001908
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001908 [doi]
LID - e1001908
AB  - BACKGROUND: The case fatality ratio (CFR) of Ebola virus disease (EVD) can vary 
      over time and space for reasons that are not fully understood. This makes it 
      difficult to define the baseline CFRs needed to evaluate treatments in the 
      absence of randomized controls. Here, we investigate whether viremia in EVD 
      patients may be used to evaluate baseline EVD CFRs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We 
      analyzed the laboratory and epidemiological records of patients with EVD 
      confirmed by reverse transcription PCR hospitalized in the Conakry area, Guinea, 
      between 1 March 2014 and 28 February 2015. We used viremia and other variables to 
      model the CFR. Data for 699 EVD patients were analyzed. In the week following 
      symptom onset, mean viremia remained stable, and the CFR increased with viremia, 
      V, from 21% (95% CI 16%-27%) for low viremia (V < 104.4 copies/ml) to 53% (95% CI 
      44%-61%) for intermediate viremia (104.4 </= V < 105.2 copies/ml) and 81% (95% CI 
      75%-87%) for high viremia (V >/= 105.2 copies/ml). Compared to adults (15-44 y old 
      [y.o.]), the CFR was larger in young children (0-4 y.o.) (odds ratio [OR]: 2.44; 
      95% CI 1.02-5.86) and older adults (>/= 45 y.o.) (OR: 2.84; 95% CI 1.81-4.46) but 
      lower in children (5-14 y.o.) (OR: 0.46; 95% CI 0.24-0.86). An order of magnitude 
      increase in mean viremia in cases after July 2014 compared to those before 
      coincided with a 14% increase in the CFR. Our findings come from a large 
      hospital-based study in Conakry and may not be generalizable to settings with 
      different case profiles, such as with individuals who never sought care. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Viremia in EVD patients was a strong predictor of death that partly 
      explained variations in CFR in the study population. This study provides baseline 
      CFRs by viremia group, which allow appropriate adjustment when estimating 
      efficacy in treatment studies. In randomized controlled trials, stratifying 
      analysis on viremia groups could reduce sample size requirements by 25%. We 
      hypothesize that monitoring the viremia of hospitalized patients may inform the 
      ability of surveillance systems to detect EVD patients from the different 
      severity strata.

TI  - Comparative Evaluation of the Diagnostic Performance of the Prototype Cepheid 
      GeneXpert Ebola Assay.
PG  - 359-67
LID - 10.1128/JCM.02724-15 [doi]
AB  - The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa has highlighted an urgent 
      need for point-of-care (POC) assays for the diagnosis of this devastating disease 
      in resource-limited African countries. The diagnostic performance characteristics 
      of a prototype Cepheid GeneXpert Ebola POC used to detect Ebola virus (EBOV) in 
      stored serum and plasma samples collected from suspected EVD cases in Sierra 
      Leone in 2014 and 2015 was evaluated. The GeneXpert Ebola POC is a self-contained 
      single-cartridge automated system that targets the glycoprotein (GP) and 
      nucleoprotein (NP) genes of EBOV and yields results within 90 min. Results from 
      281 patient samples were compared to the results of a TaqMan real-time reverse 
      transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) targeting the polymerase gene and performed on two 
      real-time PCR machines. Agreement between the three platforms was 100% at cycle 
      threshold (CT) values of </=34.99, but discordant results were noted between CT 
      values of 35 and 45.The diagnostic sensitivity of the three platforms was 100% in 
      91 patient samples that were confirmed to be infectious by virus isolation. All 
      three molecular platforms detected viral EBOV RNA in additional samples that did 
      not contain viable EBOV. The analytical sensitivity of the GeneXpert Ebola POC 
      for the detection of NP was higher, and comparable to that of polymerase gene 
      detection, than that for the detection of GP when using a titrated laboratory 
      stock of EBOV. There was no detectable cross-reactivity with other hemorrhagic 
      fever viruses or arboviruses. The GeneXpert Ebola POC offers an easy to operate 
      and sensitive diagnostic tool that can be used for the rapid screening of 
      suspected EVD cases in treatment or in holding centers during EVD outbreaks.

AB  - Ebola virus (EBOV) can lead to severe hemorrhagic fever with a high risk of death 
      in humans and other primates. To guide treatment and prevent spread of the viral 
      infection, a rapid and sensitive detection method is required for clinical 
      samples. Here, we described and evaluated a reverse transcription loop-mediated 
      isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method to detect Zaire ebolavirus using the 
      nucleoprotein gene (NP) as a target sequence. Two different techniques were used, 
      a calcein/Mn(2+) complex chromogenic method and real-time turbidity monitoring. 
      The RT-LAMP assay detected the NP target sequence with a limit of 4.56 copies/muL 
      within 45 min under 61 degrees C, a similar even or increase in sensitivity than that of 
      real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Additionally, 
      all pseudoviral particles or non- Zaire EBOV genomes were negative for LAMP 
      detection, indicating that the assay was highly specific for EBOV. To appraise 
      the availability of the RT-LAMP method for use in clinical diagnosis of EBOV, of 
      417 blood or swab samples collected from patients with clinically suspected 
      infections in Sierra Leone, 307 were identified for RT-LAMP-based surveillance of 
      EBOV. Therefore, the highly specific and sensitive RT-LAMP method allows the 
      rapid detection of EBOV, and is a suitable tool for clinical screening, 
      diagnosis, and primary quarantine purposes.

TI  - Ebola Check: Delivering molecular diagnostics at the point of need.
PG  - 144
AB  - The 2013-5 global outbreak of Ebolavirus disease brought to sharp focus the need 
      for diagnostic capacity to be equitably available on a global scale: from the 
      most under-developed areas of resource-limited countries in West Africa to high 
      volume international travel hubs in Europe and the USA. Quick detection of the 
      causal agent of disease is pivotal to containment, contact tracing and clinical 
      action to protect healthcare workers, communities and patients. Nucleic acid 
      testing (NAT) by real time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain 
      reaction (RT-PCR) has emerged as the preferred method for reliable patient status 
      confirmation. Presently, this is served through advanced clinical molecular 
      laboratory testing in a <8hr manual process that requires 3.5ml venous blood 
      samples. To meet the demand in West Africa, this has necessitated large-scale 
      mobile laboratory and volunteer biomedical scientist deployment: a solution that 
      has proven eventually adequate, albeit temporary against future re-emergence of 
      this and other haemorrhagic fever disease agents prevalent in the region. The 
      EbolaCheck consortium was formed in August 2014 to address the need for 
      delivering NAT at the point of care. We have developed a novel platform 
      technology that can QUantitatively, RAPidly IDentify (QuRapID) known RNA or DNA 
      targets in viruses, bacteria, or eukaryotic cells directly in crude biofluids, 
      including whole blood, in under 40min using a 5 microliter sample. The portable, 
      battery-operated system lacks microfluidics, pumps or other sensitive/high cost 
      parts making it suitable for the environmental and economic challenges of 
      resource-limited countries. The simple, safe, 5-step sample-to-answer process 
      requires minimal training and informs frontline healthcare workers of diagnostic 
      status, whilst reporting remotely epidemiologically relevant results. Data on 
      biosafety level 2 surrogate Ebolavirus templates presented in encapsulated or 
      enveloped viruses indicate performance comparable to clinical laboratory testing 
      and utility beyond filoviruses. Emerging performance data on live Ebolavirus, 
      non-human primate disease model and patient samples, as well as future 
      development plans will be discussed.

AB  - Evidence to inform decontamination practices at Ebola holding units (EHUs) and 
      treatment centres is lacking. We conducted an audit of decontamination procedures 
      inside Connaught Hospital EHU in Freetown, Sierra Leone, by assessing 
      environmental swab specimens for evidence of contamination with Ebola virus by 
      RT-PCR. Swabs were collected following discharge of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) 
      patients before and after routine decontamination. Prior to decontamination, 
      Ebola virus RNA was detected within a limited area at all bedside sites tested, 
      but not at any sites distant to the bedside. Following decontamination, few areas 
      contained detectable Ebola virus RNA. In areas beneath the bed there was evidence 
      of transfer of Ebola virus material during cleaning. Retraining of cleaning staff 
      reduced evidence of environmental contamination after decontamination. Current 
      decontamination procedures appear to be effective in eradicating persistence of 
      viral RNA. This study supports the use of viral swabs to assess Ebola viral 
      contamination within the clinical setting. We recommend that regular refresher 
      training of cleaning staff and audit of environmental contamination become 
      standard practice at all Ebola care facilities during EVD outbreaks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on the prevalence and predictors of 
      clinical sequelae in survivors of Ebola virus disease (EVD). The EVD Survivor 
      Clinic in Port Loko, Sierra Leone, has provided clinical care for 603 of 661 
      survivors living in the district. We did a cross-sectional study to describe the 
      prevalence, nature, and predictors of three key EVD sequelae (ocular, auditory, 
      and articular) in this cohort of EVD survivors. METHODS: We reviewed available 
      clinical and laboratory records of consecutive patients assessed in the clinic 
      between March 7, 2015, and April 24, 2015. We used univariate and multiple 
      logistic regression to examine clinical and laboratory features of acute EVD with 
      the following outcomes in convalescence: new ocular symptoms, uveitis, auditory 
      symptoms, and arthralgias. FINDINGS: Among 277 survivors (59% female), median age 
      was 29 years (IQR 20-36) and median time from discharge from an EVD treatment 
      facility to first survivor clinic visit was 121 days (82-151). Clinical sequelae 
      were common, including arthralgias (n=210, 76%), new ocular symptoms (n=167, 
      60%), uveitis (n=50, 18%), and auditory symptoms (n=67, 24%). Higher Ebola viral 
      load at acute EVD presentation (as shown by lower cycle thresholds on real-time 
      RT-PCR testing) was independently associated with uveitis (adjusted odds ratio 
      [aOR] 3.33, 95% CI 1.87-5.91, for every five-point decrease in cycle threshold) 
      and with new ocular symptoms or ocular diagnoses (aOR 3.04, 95% CI 1.87-4.94). 
      INTERPRETATION: Clinical sequelae during early EVD convalescence are common and 
      sometimes sight threatening. These findings underscore the need for early 
      clinical follow-up of survivors of EVD and urgent provision of ocular care as 
      part of health systems strengthening in EVD-affected west African countries.

TI  - Systematic review of the literature on viral persistence and sexual transmission

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this article is to present a comprehensive, systematic 
      review on evidence of sexual transmission from Ebola survivors and persistence of 
      Ebola virus in body fluids of relevance to sexual transmission, and additionally 
      to review condom effectiveness against sexual transmission of Ebola. DESIGN: We 
      performed a systematic review of viral persistence in body fluids of relevance to 
      sexual transmission of Ebola survivors and evidence of sexual transmission of 
      Ebola, and carried out a targeted review of condom effectiveness. RESULTS: We 
      identified nine published original articles presenting results on persistence of 
      Ebola virus in relevant body fluids, or reporting suspect sexual transmission 
      from Ebola survivors. We also included unpublished reports from the current 
      2014/2015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We found no articles reporting on condom 
      effectiveness, but have included a targeted review on general condom efficacy and 
      effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the risk of sexual transmission from 
      people who have recovered from Ebola cannot be ruled out. We found the longest 
      duration of persistent Ebola RNA in a relevant body fluid from a survivor, to be 
      reported from a man in Sierra Leone who had reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) 
      positive semen 284 days after symptom onset. In line with current WHO 
      recommendations. We recommend that men are offered the possibility to test their 
      semen regularly for presence of Ebola RNA from 3 months post-symptom onset. Safe 
      sex practices including sexual abstinence, or else condom use, are recommended by 
      WHO until semen has tested negative twice, or in absence of testing for at least 
      6 months post-symptom onset. Based on evidence reviewed, we conclude that male 
      and female latex condoms offer some protection against EBOV compared to no condom 
      use. Survivors should be offered access to care and prevention, in order to 
      provide them with possibilities to mitigate any risks that may occur, and efforts 
      should be linked to destigmatising activities.

AB  - Ebola virus (EV) is one of the most virulent human pathogens. Fruits bats are its 
      natural reservoir, the transmission to humans is across wild animals (especially 
      primates) and the propagation in human populations is through bodily fluid 
      contact. The actual outbreak started in December 2013 and crossed continental 
      borders. Up to now, there are 17,145 suspected and confirmed cases with 6,070 
      deaths, resulting a total case fatality rate of 35%. Clinical manifestations can 
      be divided in 3 phases. In phase I, symptoms are similar to flu, which may appear 
      in a range of 2 to 21 days. In phase II which occurs in over 50% of cases, 
      visceral symptoms and mucocutaneous manifestations appear within 4 and 5 days of 
      the onset of symptoms. The main symptoms are a macular or maculopapular 
      non-pruritic rash, desquamation and mucosal involvement of eyes, mouth and 
      pharynx. In phase III, recovery or death occurs. The diagnosis is made on 
      clinical grounds, epidemiological suspicion and a positive polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) test. The treatment is supportive. If there is a suspected case, 
      it should be notified immediately and all relevant safety measures should be 
      instituted.

TI  - Inadequate Diagnosis and Treatment of Malaria Among Travelers Returning from 
      Africa During the Ebola Epidemic--United States, 2014-2015.
PG  - 27-9
LID - 10.15585/mmwr.mm6502a3 [doi]
AB  - Among 1,683 persons in the United States who developed malaria following 
      international travel during 2012, more than half acquired disease in one of 16 
      countries in West Africa. Since March 2014, West Africa has experienced the 
      world's largest epidemic of Ebola virus disease (Ebola), primarily affecting 
      Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia; in 2014, approximately 20,000 Ebola cases were 
      reported. Both Ebola and malaria are often characterized by fever and malaise and 
      can be clinically indistinguishable, especially early in the course of disease. 
      Immediate laboratory testing is critical for diagnosis of both Ebola and malaria, 
      so that appropriate lifesaving treatment can be initiated. CDC recommends prompt 
      malaria testing of patients with fever and history of travel to an area that is 
      endemic for malaria, using blood smear microscopy, with results available within 
      a few hours. Empiric treatment of malaria is not recommended by CDC. Reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is recommended to 
      diagnose Ebola. During the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, CDC received reports of 
      delayed laboratory testing for malaria in travelers returning to the United 
      States because of infection control concerns related to Ebola. CDC reviewed 
      documented calls to its malaria consultation service and selected three patient 
      cases to present as examples of deficiencies in the evaluation and treatment of 
      malaria among travelers returning from Africa during the Ebola epidemic.

      Guinea.
PG  - 210-6
LID - 10.3201/eid2202.151238 [doi]
AB  - Rapid diagnostic methods are essential in control of Ebola outbreaks and lead to 
      timely isolation of cases and improved epidemiologic surveillance. Diagnosis 
      during Ebola outbreaks in West Africa has relied on PCR performed in laboratories 
      outside this region. Because time between sampling and PCR results can be 
      considerable, we assessed the feasibility and added value of using the Xpert 
      Ebola Assay in an Ebola control program in Guinea. A total of 218 samples were 
      collected during diagnosis, treatment, and convalescence of patients. Median time 
      for obtaining results was reduced from 334 min to 165 min. Twenty-six samples 
      were positive for Ebola virus. Xpert cycle thresholds were consistently lower, 
      and 8 (31%) samples were negative by routine PCR. Several logistic and safety 
      issues were identified. We suggest that implementation of the Xpert Ebola Assay 
      under programmatic conditions is feasible and represents a major advance in 
      diagnosis of Ebola virus disease without apparent loss of assay sensitivity.

AB  - To determine whether 2 readily available indicators predicted survival among 
      patients with Ebola virus disease in Sierra Leone, we evaluated information for 
      216 of the 227 patients in Bo District during a 4-month period. The indicators 
      were time from symptom onset to healthcare facility admission and quantitative 
      real-time reverse transcription PCR cycle threshold (Ct), a surrogate for viral 
      load, in first Ebola virus-positive blood sample tested. Of these patients, 151 
      were alive when detected and had reported healthcare facility admission dates and 
      Ct values available. Time from symptom onset to healthcare facility admission was 
      not associated with survival, but viral load in the first Ebola virus-positive 
      blood sample was inversely associated with survival: 52 (87%) of 60 patients with 
      a Ct of >24 survived and 20 (22%) of 91 with a Ct of <24 survived. Ct values may 
      be useful for clinicians making treatment decisions or managing patient or family 
      expectations.

AB  - The ability to make rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases broadly available in a 
      portable, low-cost format would mark a great step forward in global health. Many 
      molecular diagnostic assays are developed based on using thermal cyclers to carry 
      out polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse-transcription PCR for DNA and RNA 
      amplification and detection, respectively. Unfortunately, most commercial thermal 
      cyclers are expensive and need continuous electrical power supply, so they are 
      not suitable for uses in low-resource settings. We have previously reported a 
      low-cost and simple approach to amplify DNA using vacuum insulated stainless 
      steel thermoses food cans, which we have named it thermos thermal cycler or TTC. 
      Here, we describe the use of an improved set up to enable the detection of viral 
      RNA targets by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), thus expanding the TTC's 
      ability to identify highly infectious, RNA virus-based diseases in low resource 
      settings. The TTC was successful in demonstrating high-speed and sensitive 
      detection of DNA or RNA targets of sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, Ebola 
      hemorrhagic fever, and dengue fever. Our innovative TTC costs less than $200 to 
      build and has a capacity of at least eight tubes. In terms of speed, the TTC's 
      performance exceeded that of commercial thermal cyclers tested. When coupled with 
      low-cost endpoint detection technologies such as nucleic acid lateral-flow assay 
      or a cell-phone-based fluorescence detector, the TTC will increase the 
      availability of on-site molecular diagnostics in low-resource settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of Ebola virus disease relies on the detection of viral 
      RNA in blood by real-time reverse-transcription PCR. While several of these 
      assays were developed during the unprecedented 2013-2015 Ebola virus disease 
      outbreak in West Africa, few were applied in the field. OBJECTIVES: To compare 
      technical performances and practical aspects of 11 Ebola virus real-time 
      reverse-transcription PCR procedures. STUDY DESIGN: We selected the most 
      promising assays using serial dilutions of culture-derived Ebola virus RNA and 
      determined their analytical sensitivity and potential range of quantification 
      using quantified in vitro transcribed RNA; viral load values in the serum of an 
      Ebola virus disease patient obtained with these assays were reported. Finally, 
      ease of use and turnaround times of these kits were evaluated. RESULTS: 
      Commercial assays were at least as sensitive as in-house tests. Five of the 
      former (Altona, Roche, Fast-track Diagnostics, and Life Technologies) were 
      selected for further evaluation. Despite differences in analytical sensitivity 
      and limits of quantification, all of them were suitable for Ebola virus diagnosis 
      and viral load estimation. The Lifetech Lyophilized Ebola Virus (Zaire 2014) 
      assay (Life Technologies) appeared particularly promising, displaying the highest 
      analytical sensitivity and shortest turnaround time, in addition to requiring no 
      reagent freezing. CONCLUSIONS: Commercial kits were at least as sensitive as 
      in-house tests and potentially easier to use in the field than the latter. This 
      qualitative comparison of real-time reverse transcription PCR assays may serve as 
      a basis for the design of future Ebola virus disease diagnostics.

AB  - Given the current absence of specific drugs or vaccines for Ebola virus disease 
      (EVD), rapid, sensitive, and reliable diagnostic methods are required to stem the 
      transmission chain of the disease. We have developed a rapid detection assay for 
      Zaire ebolavirus based on reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal 
      amplification (RT-LAMP) and coupled with a novel portable isothermal 
      amplification and detection platform. The RT-LAMP assay is based on primer sets 
      that target the untranscribed trailer region or nucleoprotein coding region of 
      the viral RNA. The test could specifically detect viral RNAs of Central and West 
      African Ebola virus strains within 15 minutes with no cross-reactivity to other 
      hemorrhagic fever viruses and arboviruses, which cause febrile disease. The assay 
      was evaluated using a total of 100 clinical specimens (serum, n = 44; oral swab, 
      n = 56) collected from suspected EVD cases in Guinea. The specificity of this 
      diagnostic test was 100% for both primer sets, while the sensitivity was 100% and 
      97.9% for the trailer and nucleoprotein primer sets, respectively, compared with 
      a reference standard RT-PCR test. These observations suggest that our diagnostic 
      assay is useful for identifying EVD cases, especially in the field or in settings 
      with insufficient infrastructure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2013-15 Ebola outbreak was unprecedented due to sustained 
      transmission within urban environments and thousands of survivors. In 2014 the 
      World Health Organization stated that there was insufficient evidence to give 
      definitive guidance about which body fluids are infectious and when they pose a 
      risk to humans. We report a rapid systematic review of published evidence on the 
      presence of filoviruses in body fluids of infected people and survivors. METHODS: 
      Scientific articles were screened for information about filovirus in human body 
      fluids. The aim was to find primary data that suggested high likelihood of 
      actively infectious filovirus in human body fluids (viral RNA). Eligible 
      infections were from Marburg virus (MARV or RAVV) and Zaire, Sudan, Tai Forest 
      and Bundibugyo species of Ebola. Cause of infection had to be laboratory 
      confirmed (in practice either tissue culture or RT-PCR tests), or evidenced by 
      compatible clinical history with subsequent positivity for filovirus antibodies 
      or inflammatory factors. Data were extracted and summarized narratively. RESULTS: 
      6831 unique articles were found, and after screening, 33 studies were eligible. 
      For most body fluid types there were insufficient patients to draw strong 
      conclusions, and prevalence of positivity was highly variable. Body fluids taken 
      >16 days after onset were usually negative. In the six studies that used both 
      assay methods RT-PCR tests for filovirus RNA gave positive results about 4 times 
      more often than tissue culture. CONCLUSIONS: Filovirus was reported in most types 
      of body fluid, but not in every sample from every otherwise confirmed patient. 
      Apart from semen, most non-blood, RT-PCR positive samples are likely to be 
      culture negative and so possibly of low infectious risk. Nevertheless, it is not 
      apparent how relatively infectious many body fluids are during or after illness, 
      even when culture-positive, not least because most test results come from more 
      severe cases. Contact with blood and blood-stained body fluids remains the major 
      risk for disease transmission because of the known high viral loads in blood.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a highly lethal condition for which no 
      specific treatment has proven efficacy. In September 2014, while the Ebola 
      outbreak was at its peak, the World Health Organization released a short list of 
      drugs suitable for EVD research. Favipiravir, an antiviral developed for the 
      treatment of severe influenza, was one of these. In late 2014, the conditions for 
      starting a randomized Ebola trial were not fulfilled for two reasons. One was the 
      perception that, given the high number of patients presenting simultaneously and 
      the very high mortality rate of the disease, it was ethically unacceptable to 
      allocate patients from within the same family or village to receive or not 
      receive an experimental drug, using a randomization process impossible to 
      understand by very sick patients. The other was that, in the context of rumors 
      and distrust of Ebola treatment centers, using a randomized design at the outset 
      might lead even more patients to refuse to seek care. Therefore, we chose to 
      conduct a multicenter non-randomized trial, in which all patients would receive 
      favipiravir along with standardized care. The objectives of the trial were to 
      test the feasibility and acceptability of an emergency trial in the context of a 
      large Ebola outbreak, and to collect data on the safety and effectiveness of 
      favipiravir in reducing mortality and viral load in patients with EVD. The trial 
      was not aimed at directly informing future guidelines on Ebola treatment but at 
      quickly gathering standardized preliminary data to optimize the design of future 
      studies. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Inclusion criteria were positive Ebola virus 
      reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) test, age >/= 1 y, weight >/= 10 kg, ability to 
      take oral drugs, and informed consent. All participants received oral favipiravir 
      (day 0: 6,000 mg; day 1 to day 9: 2,400 mg/d). Semi-quantitative Ebola virus 
      RT-PCR (results expressed in "cycle threshold" [Ct]) and biochemistry tests were 
      performed at day 0, day 2, day 4, end of symptoms, day 14, and day 30. Frozen 
      samples were shipped to a reference biosafety level 4 laboratory for RNA viral 
      load measurement using a quantitative reference technique (genome 
      copies/milliliter). Outcomes were mortality, viral load evolution, and adverse 
      events. The analysis was stratified by age and Ct value. A "target value" of 
      mortality was defined a priori for each stratum, to guide the interpretation of 
      interim and final analysis. Between 17 December 2014 and 8 April 2015, 126 
      patients were included, of whom 111 were analyzed (adults and adolescents, >/=13 y, 
      n = 99; young children, </=6 y, n = 12). Here we present the results obtained in 
      the 99 adults and adolescents. Of these, 55 had a baseline Ct value >/= 20 (Group A 
      Ct >/= 20), and 44 had a baseline Ct value < 20 (Group A Ct < 20). Ct values and 
      RNA viral loads were well correlated, with Ct = 20 corresponding to RNA viral 
      load = 7.7 log10 genome copies/ml. Mortality was 20% (95% CI 11.6%-32.4%) in 
      Group A Ct >/= 20 and 91% (95% CI 78.8%-91.1%) in Group A Ct < 20. Both mortality 
      95% CIs included the predefined target value (30% and 85%, respectively). 
      Baseline serum creatinine was >/=110 mumol/l in 48% of patients in Group A Ct >/= 20 
      (>/=300 mumol/l in 14%) and in 90% of patients in Group A Ct < 20 (>/=300 mumol/l in 
      44%). In Group A Ct >/= 20, 17% of patients with baseline creatinine >/=110 mumol/l 
      died, versus 97% in Group A Ct < 20. In patients who survived, the mean decrease 
      in viral load was 0.33 log10 copies/ml per day of follow-up. RNA viral load 
      values and mortality were not significantly different between adults starting 
      favipiravir within <72 h of symptoms compared to others. Favipiravir was well 
      tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of an outbreak at its peak, with crowded 
      care centers, randomizing patients to receive either standard care or standard 
      care plus an experimental drug was not felt to be appropriate. We did a 
      non-randomized trial. This trial reaches nuanced conclusions. On the one hand, we 
      do not conclude on the efficacy of the drug, and our conclusions on tolerance, 
      although encouraging, are not as firm as they could have been if we had used 
      randomization. On the other hand, we learned about how to quickly set up and run 
      an Ebola trial, in close relationship with the community and non-governmental 
      organizations; we integrated research into care so that it improved care; and we 
      generated knowledge on EVD that is useful to further research. Our data 
      illustrate the frequency of renal dysfunction and the powerful prognostic value 
      of low Ct values. They suggest that drug trials in EVD should systematically 
      stratify analyses by baseline Ct value, as a surrogate of viral load. They also 
      suggest that favipiravir monotherapy merits further study in patients with medium 
      to high viremia, but not in those with very high viremia. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02329054.

COIS- I have read the journal's policy and the authors of this manuscript have the 
      following competing interests: SB, XdL, HR, and SG received a grant from St Luke 
      International University (Tokyo, Japan) to perform research on favipiravir in 
      non-human primates. YY declared board membership for AbbVie, BMS, Gilead, MSD, 
      Roche, Johnson&Johnson, ViiV Healthcare, Pfizer, and consultancy for AbbVie, BMS, 
      Gilead, MSD, Roche, Johnson&Johnson, ViiV Healthcare, and Pfizer. OP worked for 
      Fab'entech biotechnology from 1st April to 13th November 2015. Between January 
      2014 and now, SC received a grant from the CHU de Quebec research center, which 
      had no relationship with the trial described in the paper. All other authors 
      declared no conflict of interest.

TI  - Ultrafast, sensitive and large-volume on-chip real-time PCR for the molecular 
      diagnosis of bacterial and viral infections.
PG  - 1401-11
LID - 10.1039/c5lc01459j [doi]
AB  - To control future infectious disease outbreaks, like the 2014 Ebola epidemic, it 
      is necessary to develop ultrafast molecular assays enabling rapid and sensitive 
      diagnoses. To that end, several ultrafast real-time PCR systems have been 
      previously developed, but they present issues that hinder their wide adoption, 
      notably regarding their sensitivity and detection volume. An ultrafast, sensitive 
      and large-volume real-time PCR system based on microfluidic thermalization is 
      presented herein. The method is based on the circulation of pre-heated liquids in 
      a microfluidic chip that thermalize the PCR chamber by diffusion and ultrafast 
      flow switches. The system can achieve up to 30 real-time PCR cycles in around 2 
      minutes, which makes it the fastest PCR thermalization system for regular sample 
      volume to the best of our knowledge. After biochemical optimization, anthrax and 
      Ebola simulating agents could be respectively detected by a real-time PCR in 7 
      minutes and a reverse transcription real-time PCR in 7.5 minutes. These 
      detections are respectively 6.4 and 7.2 times faster than with an off-the-shelf 
      apparatus, while conserving real-time PCR sample volume, efficiency, selectivity 
      and sensitivity. The high-speed thermalization also enabled us to perform sharp 
      melting curve analyses in only 20 s and to discriminate amplicons of different 
      lengths by rapid real-time PCR. This real-time PCR microfluidic thermalization 
      system is cost-effective, versatile and can be then further developed for 
      point-of-care, multiplexed, ultrafast and highly sensitive molecular diagnoses of 
      bacterial and viral diseases.

PG  - 641-6
LID - 10.3201/eid2204.151302 [doi]
AB  - Thousands of persons have survived Ebola virus disease. Almost all survivors 
      describe symptoms that persist or develop after hospital discharge. A 
      cross-sectional survey of the symptoms of all survivors from the Ebola treatment 
      unit (ETU) at 34th Regimental Military Hospital, Freetown, Sierra Leone (MH34), 
      was conducted after discharge at their initial follow-up appointment within 3 
      weeks after their second negative PCR result. From its opening on December 1, 
      2014, through March 31, 2015, the MH34 ETU treated 84 persons (8-70 years of age) 
      with PCR-confirmed Ebola virus disease, of whom 44 survived. Survivors reported 
      musculoskeletal pain (70%), headache (48%), and ocular problems (14%). Those who 
      reported headache had had lower admission cycle threshold Ebola PCR than did 
      those who did not (p<0.03). This complete survivor cohort from 1 ETU enables 
      analysis of the proportion of symptoms of post-Ebola syndrome. The Ebola epidemic 
      is waning, but the effects of the disease will remain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Throughout the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa, 
      field laboratory testing for EVD has relied on complex, multi-step real-time 
      reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assays; an accurate sample-to-answer RT-PCR 
      test would reduce time to results and potentially increase access to testing. We 
      evaluated the performance of the Cepheid GeneXpert Ebola assay on clinical 
      venipuncture whole blood (WB) and buccal swab (BS) specimens submitted to a field 
      biocontainment laboratory in Sierra Leone for routine EVD testing by RT-PCR 
      ("Trombley assay"). METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study was conducted in the Public 
      Health England EVD diagnostic laboratory in Port Loko, Sierra Leone, using 
      residual diagnostic specimens remaining after clinical testing. EDTA-WB specimens 
      (n = 218) were collected from suspected or confirmed EVD patients between April 1 
      and July 20, 2015. BS specimens (n = 71) were collected as part of a national 
      postmortem screening program between March 7 and July 20, 2015. EDTA-WB and BS 
      specimens were tested with Xpert (targets: glycoprotein [GP] and nucleoprotein 
      [NP] genes) and Trombley (target: NP gene) assays in parallel. All WB specimens 
      were fresh; 84/218 were tested in duplicate on Xpert to compare WB sampling 
      methods (pipette versus swab); 43/71 BS specimens had been previously frozen. In 
      all, 7/218 (3.2%) WB and 7/71 (9.9%) BS samples had Xpert results that were 
      reported as "invalid" or "error" and were excluded, leaving 211 WB and 64 BS 
      samples with valid Trombley and Xpert results. For WB, 22/22 Trombley-positive 
      samples were Xpert-positive (sensitivity 100%, 95% CI 84.6%-100%), and 181/189 
      Trombley-negative samples were Xpert-negative (specificity 95.8%, 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 91.8%-98.2%). Seven of the eight Trombley-negative, Xpert-positive 
      (Xpert cycle threshold [Ct] range 37.7-43.4) WB samples were confirmed to be 
      follow-up submissions from previously Trombley-positive EVD patients, suggesting 
      a revised Xpert specificity of 99.5% (95% CI 97.0%-100%). For Xpert-positive WB 
      samples (n = 22), Xpert NP Ct values were consistently lower than GP Ct values 
      (mean difference -4.06, 95% limits of agreement -6.09, -2.03); Trombley (NP) Ct 
      values closely matched Xpert NP Ct values (mean difference -0.04, 95% limits of 
      agreement -2.93, 2.84). Xpert results (positive/negative) for WB sampled by 
      pipette versus swab were concordant for 78/79 (98.7%) WB samples, with comparable 
      Ct values for positive results. For BS specimens, 20/20 Trombley-positive samples 
      were Xpert-positive (sensitivity 100%, 95% CI 83.2%-100%), and 44/44 
      Trombley-negative samples were Xpert-negative (specificity 100%, 95% CI 
      92.0%-100%). This study was limited to testing residual diagnostic samples, some 
      of which had been frozen before use; it was not possible to test the performance 
      of the Xpert Ebola assay at point of care. CONCLUSIONS: The Xpert Ebola assay had 
      excellent performance compared to an established RT-PCR benchmark on WB and BS 
      samples in a field laboratory setting. Future studies should evaluate feasibility 
      and performance outside of a biocontainment laboratory setting to facilitate 
      expanded access to testing.

AB  - The 2014 Ebola epidemic is the largest to date. There is no cure or treatment for 
      this deadly disease; therefore there is an urgent need to develop new diagnostics 
      to accurately detect Ebola. Current RT-PCR assays lack sensitive and reliable 
      positive controls. To address this critical need, we devised a bio-inspired 
      positive control for use in RT-PCR diagnostics: we encapsulated scrambled Ebola 
      RNA sequences inside of tobacco mosaic virus to create a biomimicry that is 
      non-infectious, but stable, and could therefore serve as a positive control in 
      Ebola diagnostic assays. Here, we report the bioengineering and validation of 
      this probe.

AB  - Prior to 2015, Zika Virus (ZIKV) outbreaks had occurred in areas of Africa, 
      Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Although a causal relationship between 
      Zika infection during pregnancy and microcephaly is strongly suspected, such a 
      connection has not yet been scientifically proven. In May 2015, the outbreak of 
      ZIKV infection in Brazil led to reports of syndrome and pregnant women giving 
      birth to babies with birth defects and poor pregnancy outcomes; the Pan American 
      Health Organization (PAHO) issued an alert regarding the first confirmed ZIKV 
      infection in Brazil. Currently, ZIKV outbreaks are ongoing and it will be 
      difficult to predict how the virus will spread over time. ZIKV is transmitted to 
      humans primarily through the bite of infected mosquitos, Aedes aegypti and Aedes 
      albopictus. These mosquitoes are the principle vectors of dengue, and ZIKV 
      disease generally is reported to include symptoms associated with acute febrile 
      illnesses that clinically resembles dengue fever. The laboratory diagnosis can be 
      performed by using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 
      serum, viral nucleic acid and virus-specific immunoglobulin M. There is currently 
      no vaccine and antiviral treatment available for ZIKV infection, and the only way 
      to prevent congenital ZIKV infection is to prevent maternal infection. In 
      February 2016, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) activated ZIKV 
      as a Category V Notifiable Infectious Disease similar to Ebola virus disease and 
      MERS.

TI  - The etiology of Ebola virus disease-like illnesses in Ebola virusnegative 
      patients from Sierra Leone.

LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.8558 [doi]
AB  - During the 2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, less than half of 
      EVD-suspected cases were laboratory tested as Ebola virus (EBOV)-negative, but 
      disease identity remained unknown. In this study we investigated the etiology of 
      EVD-like illnesses in EBOV-negative cases. From November 13, 2014 to March 16, 
      2015, EVD-suspected patients were admitted to Jui Government Hospital and 
      assessed for EBOV infection by real-time PCR. Of 278 EBOV negative patients, 223 
      (80.21%), 142 (51.08%), 123 (44.24%), 114 (41.01%), 59 (21.22%), 35 (12.59%), and 
      12 (4.32%) reported fever, headache, joint pain, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, 
      diarrhea, hemorrhage, respectively. Furthermore, 121 (43.52%), 44 (15.83%), 36 
      (12.95%), 33 (11.87%), 23 (8.27%), 10 (3.60%) patients were diagnosed as 
      infection with malaria, HIV, Lassa fever, tuberculosis, yellow fever, and 
      pneumonia, respectively. No significant differences in clinical features and 
      symptoms were found between non-EVD and EVD patients. To the best of our 
      knowledge, the present study is the first to explore the etiology of EVD-like 
      illnesses in uninfected patients in Sierra Leone, highlighting the importance of 
      accurate diagnosis to EVD confirmation.

TI  - The close genetic relationship of lineage D Betacoronavirus from Nigerian and 
      Kenyan straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) is consistent with the existence 
      of a single epidemiological unit across sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - Straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum), which have been identified as natural 
      hosts for several zoonotic pathogens, such as lyssaviruses, henipaviruses, and 
      ebolavirus, are associated with human settlements in Nigeria where they are 
      commonly consumed as a delicacy. However, information on the viruses harbored by 
      these bats is scarce. In this study, coronavirus sequences were detected using a 
      nested RT-PCR targeting 440 bp of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in six 
      of 79 fecal samples collected from an urban colony of E. helvum in Ibadan, 
      Nigeria. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all six sequences were monophyletic 
      and clustered in lineage D of Betacoronavirus. The extension of two fragments 
      allowed us to classify our sequences within the RdRp Group Unit defined for 
      Kenyan Betacoronavirus from the same host species. These findings are consistent 
      with the previous suggestion on the existence of a single epidemiological unit of 
      E. helvum across sub-Saharan Africa. This theory, which is supported by the 
      genetic structure of continental E. helvum, could facilitate viral mixing between 
      different colonies across the continent.

AB  - We show the utilization of a recently developed cellphone-sized real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) device to detect Ebola virus RNA using 
      single-step reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The device was shown to 
      concurrently perform four PCRs, each with a sample volume of 100 nL: one positive 
      control with both Ebola and GAPDH RNA and one negative control. The last two 
      positions were used to measure the GAPDH and the Ebola content of a sample. A 
      comparison of threshold cycles (CT) from the two samples provided relative 
      quantification. The entire process, which consisted of reverse transcription, PCR 
      amplification, and melting curve analysis (MCA), was conducted in less than 37 
      min. The next step will be integration with a sample preparation unit to form an 
      integrated sample-to-answer system for point-of-care infectious disease 
      diagnostics.

AB  - Ebola virus belongs to the Filoviridae family and includes several species, 
      including the Ebola Zaire virus, responsible for an initial outbreak of 
      hemorrhagic fever in 1976 and the current epidemic of West Africa. Fruit bats of 
      tropicalforests are the likely reservoir of this enveloped RNA virus which, 
      following the incidental infection of a human being, is efficiently transmitted 
      from man to man. Ebola virus exhibits a wide cell and tissue tropism and causes a 
      deleterious acute infection leading to severe sepsis burdened with a heavy 
      mortality. During the acute phase, the virus is very abundant in biological 
      fluids where it can temporarily retain its infectivity for several days after 
      death. Virological diagnosis is done mainly by RT-PCR on a blood sample and needs 
      to be practiced in high security conditions. The pathophysiology of the infection 
      allows to consider curative treatments and vaccination which are urgently needed.

AB  - In order to evaluate the clinical characteristics of confirmed Ebola Virus 
      Disease (EVD) patients admitted to the China Ebola Treatment Unit (China ETU) 
      between January 2015 and March 2015, we retrospectively analyzed clinical 
      symptoms, treatment, and epidemiologic features of 5 patients with confirmed EVD, 
      and reviewed the relevant medical literature. Of these, 3 patients survived, and 
      2 died. The time interval from the onset of symptoms to the negative PCR test for 
      Ebola virus in the 3 survivors was 14-18 days. All survivors reported direct 
      contact with confirmed EVD patients up to 21 days prior to admission. All 
      patients developed a fever, fatigue, and anorexia. Fever was generally the first 
      symptom to develop, followed by a gastrointestinal phase characterized by 
      vomiting/nausea (3 cases, 60%), diarrhea (3 cases), and abdominal pain (4 cases, 
      80%). Three patients (60%) reported joint pain, muscle pain, and conjunctival 
      hemorrhage, respectively, and 2 patients (40%) developed a headache. We concluded 
      that strict isolation and interruption of the route of transmission were required 
      for suspected or confirmed EVD patients. The main treatment strategies were 
      supportive care, maintenance of blood volume and electrolyte balance, and the 
      prevention of complications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In survivors of Ebola virus disease, clinical sequelae including 
      uveitis, arthralgia, and fatigue are common and necessitate systematic follow-up. 
      However, the infection risk to health-care providers is poorly defined. Here we 
      report Ebola virus RT-PCR data for body site and fluid samples from a large 
      cohort of Ebola virus survivors at clinic follow-up. METHODS: In this 
      cross-sectional cohort study, consecutive survivors of Ebola virus disease 
      attending Kerry Town survivor clinic (Freetown, Sierra Leone), who had been 
      discharged from the Kerry Town Ebola treatment unit, were invited to participate. 
      We collected and tested axillary, blood, conjunctival, forehead, mouth, rectal, 
      semen, urine, and vaginal specimens for presence of Ebola virus using RT-PCR. We 
      regarded samples to be positive for Ebola virus disease if the cycle threshold 
      was 40 or lower. We collected demographic data from survivors of their age, sex, 
      time since discharge from the treatment unit, and length of acute admission in 
      the Ebola treatment unit using anonymised standard forms. FINDINGS: Between April 
      2, and June 16, 2015, of 151 survivors of Ebola virus disease invited to 
      participate, 112 (74%) provided consent. The median age of participants was 21.5 
      years (IQR 14-31.5) with 34 (30%) participants younger than 16 years. 50 (45%) of 
      112 participants were male. We tested a total of 555 specimens: 103 from the 
      axilla, 93 from blood, 92 from conjunctiva, 54 from forehead, 105 from mouth, 17 
      from the rectum, one from semen, 69 from urine, and 21 from the vagina. The 
      median time from Ebola treatment unit discharge to specimen collection was 142 
      days (IQR 127-159). 15 participants had a total of 74 swabs taken less than 100 
      days from discharge. The semen sample from one participant tested positive for 
      Ebola virus at 114 days after discharge from the treatment unit; specimens taken 
      from the axilla, blood, conjunctiva, forehead, mouth, rectum, and urine of the 
      same participant tested negative. All specimens from the other 111 participants 
      tested negative. INTERPRETATION: Patients recovering from Ebola virus disease who 
      do not meet the case definition for acute disease pose a low infection risk to 
      health-care providers 6 weeks after clearance of viraemia. Personal protective 
      equipment after this time might be limited to standard barrier precautions, 
      unless contact with fluids from sanctuary sites is envisaged. FUNDING: Save the 
      Children International, Public Health England.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The CDC states that laboratory testing for persons under 
      investigation for Ebola virus disease can be safely performed using automated 
      laboratory instruments by adhering to bloodborne pathogen practices. We therefore 
      sought to investigate the levels of viral contamination of a total laboratory 
      automation (TLA) system to guide risk mitigation strategies for handling 
      infectious agents. METHODS: Environmental swabs followed by PCR for hepatitis B 
      (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) viruses were taken from a chemistry TLA system during 
      routine clinical use and after running a small number of high-titer HCV samples. 
      Control experiments were performed to ensure the recovery of DNA and RNA viruses 
      by swabs from a representative nonporous surface. RESULTS: Of 79 baseline swabs 
      for nucleic acids performed on the TLA system, 10 were positive for HBV and 8 for 
      HCV. Viral nucleic acid was consistently detected from swabs taken from the 
      distal inside surface of the decapper discharge chute, with areas adjacent to the 
      decapper instrument and the centrifuge rotor also positive for HBV or HCV nucleic 
      acid. Contamination was occasionally detected on exposed surfaces in areas 
      without protective barriers between samples and personnel. After running known 
      HCV-positive samples, at least one additional site of contamination was detected 
      on an exposed area of the line. CONCLUSIONS: A low level of viral contamination 
      of automated clinical laboratory equipment occurs in clinical use. Given the 
      risks associated with highly infectious agents, there is a need for 
      risk-mitigation procedures when handling all samples.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are thousands of survivors of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in west 
      Africa. Ebola virus can persist in survivors for months in immune-privileged 
      sites; however, viral relapse causing life-threatening and potentially 
      transmissible disease has not been described. We report a case of late relapse in 
      a patient who had been treated for severe Ebola virus disease with high viral 
      load (peak cycle threshold value 13.2). METHODS: A 39-year-old female nurse from 
      Scotland, who had assisted the humanitarian effort in Sierra Leone, had received 
      intensive supportive treatment and experimental antiviral therapies, and had been 
      discharged with undetectable Ebola virus RNA in peripheral blood. The patient was 
      readmitted to hospital 9 months after discharge with symptoms of acute 
      meningitis, and was found to have Ebola virus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). She 
      was treated with supportive therapy and experimental antiviral drug GS-5734 
      (Gilead Sciences, San Francisco, Foster City, CA, USA). We monitored Ebola virus 
      RNA in CSF and plasma, and sequenced the viral genome using an unbiased 
      metagenomic approach. FINDINGS: On admission, reverse transcriptase PCR 
      identified Ebola virus RNA at a higher level in CSF (cycle threshold value 23.7) 
      than plasma (31.3); infectious virus was only recovered from CSF. The patient 
      developed progressive meningoencephalitis with cranial neuropathies and 
      radiculopathy. Clinical recovery was associated with addition of high-dose 
      corticosteroids during GS-5734 treatment. CSF Ebola virus RNA slowly declined and 
      was undetectable following 14 days of treatment with GS-5734. Sequencing of 
      plasma and CSF viral genome revealed only two non-coding changes compared with 
      the original infecting virus. INTERPRETATION: Our report shows that previously 
      unanticipated, late, severe relapses of Ebola virus can occur, in this case in 
      the CNS. This finding fundamentally redefines what is known about the natural 
      history of Ebola virus infection. Vigilance should be maintained in the thousands 
      of Ebola survivors for cases of relapsed infection. The potential for these cases 
      to initiate new transmission chains is a serious public health concern. FUNDING:

AB  - Confirming Ebola virus disease (EVD), a deadly infectious disease, requires 
      real-time RT-PCR, which takes up to a few hours to yield results. Therefore, a 
      rapid diagnostic assay is imperative for EVD diagnosis. A rapid nucleic acid test 
      based on recombinase polymerase amplification (EBOV-RPA) was developed to 
      specifically detect the 2014 outbreak strains. The EBOV-RPA assay was evaluated 
      by testing samples from suspected EVD patients in parallel with RT-PCR. An 
      EBOV-RPA, which could be completed in 20 min, was successfully developed. Of 271 
      patients who tested positive for Ebola virus by RT-PCR, 264 (sensitivity: 97%, 
      95% CI: 95.5-99.3%) were positive by EBOV-RPA; 101 of 104 patients (specificity: 
      97%, 95% CI: 93.9-100%) who tested negative by RT-PCR were also negative by 
      EBOV-RPA. The sensitivity values for samples with a Ct value of <34, which 
      accounted for 95.59% of the samples, was 100%. Discordant samples positive by 
      RT-PCR but negative by EBOV-RPA had significantly high Ct values. Results of 
      external quality assessment samples with EBOV-RPA were 100%, consistent with 
      those of RT-PCR. The EBOV-RPA assay showed 97% sensitivity and 97% specificity 
      for all EVD samples tested, making it a rapid and sensitive test for EVD 
      diagnosis.

TI  - Development, Evaluation, and Integration of a Quantitative Reverse-Transcription

      Diagnostics Platform.
PG  - S192-S202
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa resulted in accelerated 
      development of rapid diagnostic tests for emergency outbreak preparedness. We 
      describe the development and evaluation of the Idylla prototype Ebola virus 
      test, a fully automated sample-to-result molecular diagnostic test for rapid 
      detection of Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) and Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV). METHODS: The 
      Idylla prototype Ebola virus test can simultaneously detect EBOV and SUDV in 200 
      microL of whole blood. The sample is directly added to a disposable cartridge 
      containing all reagents for sample preparation, RNA extraction, and amplification 
      by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. The performance was 
      evaluated with a variety of sample types, including synthetic constructs and 
      whole blood samples from healthy volunteers spiked with viral RNA, inactivated 
      virus, and infectious virus. RESULTS: The 95% limits of detection for EBOV and 
      SUDV were 465 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL (1010 copies/mL) and 324 PFU/mL (8204 
      copies/mL), respectively. In silico and in vitro analyses demonstrated 100% 
      correct reactivity for EBOV and SUDV and no cross-reactivity with relevant 
      pathogens. The diagnostic sensitivity was 97.4% (for EBOV) and 91.7% (for SUDV), 
      the specificity was 100%, and the diagnostic accuracy was 95.9%. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      Idylla prototype Ebola virus test is a fast, safe, easy-to-use, and near-patient 
      test that meets the performance criteria to detect EBOV in patients with 
      suspected Ebola.

AB  - The Ebola virus is highly infectious and can result in death in </= 90% of infected 
      subjects. Detection of the Ebola virus and diagnosis of infection are extremely 
      important for epidemic control. Presently, Chinese laboratories detect the 
      nucleic acids of the Ebola virus by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase 
      chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, such detection takes a relatively long time and 
      necessitates skilled personnel and expensive equipment. Enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of serum is simple, easy to operate, and can be used 
      to ascertain if a patient is infected with the Ebola virus as well as the degree 
      of infection. Hence, ELISA can be used in epidemiological investigations and is a 
      strong complement to detection of nucleic acids. Cases of Ebola hemorrhagic fever 
      have not been documented in China, so quality-control material for positive 
      serology is needed. Construction and expression of human-mouse chimeric 
      antibodies against the nucleoprotein of the Ebola virus was carried out. Genes 
      encoding variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) chains were extracted and 
      amplified from murine hybridoma cells. Genes encoding the VH and VL chains of 
      monoclonal antibodies were amplified by RT-PCR. According to sequence analyses, a 
      primer was designed to amplify functional sequences relative to VH and VL chain. 
      The eukaryotic expression vector HL51-14 carrying some human antibody heavy 
      chain- and light chain-constant regions was used. IgG antibodies were obtained by 
      transient transfection of 293T cells. Subsequently, immunological detection and 
      immunological identification were identified by ELISA, immunofluorescence assay, 
      and western blotting. These results showed that we constructed and purified two 
      human- mouse chimeric antibodies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The last ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak has been the most 
      important since 1976. EVD cases decreased drastically in Sierra Leone at the 
      beginning of 2015. We aim to determine the clinical findings and evolution of 
      patients admitted to an Ebola treatment center (ETC) during the epidemic's late 
      phase. METHODS: We analyze retrospectively data of patients admitted to the 
      Moyamba ETC (December 2014-March 2015). Patients were classified in EVD or 
      non-EVD patients according to the results of Ebola virus real-time reverse 
      transcription polymerase chain reaction (ZAIRE-RT-PCR). RESULTS: Seventy-five 
      patients were included, 41.3 % were positive for ZAIRE-RT-PCR. More women (68 % 
      vs 28 %, p = 0.001) were EVD-positive. More EVD patients had previous contact 
      with an Ebola patient (74.2 % vs 36.3 %, p < 0.001). At admission, EVD patients 
      were more likely to have fatigue (96.7 %, p < 0.001), diarrhea (67.7 %, 
      p = 0.002), and muscle pain (61.3 %, p = 0.009); but only objective fevers in 
      35.5 % of EVD patients. The most reliable criteria for diagnosis were: contact 
      with an Ebola patient plus three WHO symptoms (LR + =3.7, 95 % CI = 1.9-7.3), and 
      positive contact (LR + =2.3, 95 % CI = 1.15-4.20). Only 45.2 % of EVD patients 
      developed fevers during stay, but 75 % developed gastrointestinal symptoms. 
      Non-EVD patients had gastrointestinal problems (33 %), respiratory conditions 
      (26.6 %), and others such as malaria, HIV or tuberculosis with a mortality rate 
      of 11.4 %. vs 58 % in EVD group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: More non-EVD patients 
      were admitted in the outbreak's late phases. The low percentage of initial fever 
      highlights the need to emphasize the epidemiological information. EVD patients 
      presented new symptoms getting worse and requiring closer follow-up. Diagnoses of 
      non-EVD patients were diverse with a remarkable mortality, presenting a challenge 
      for the health system.

AB  - On January 14, 2016, the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation was 
      notified that a buccal swab collected on January 12 from a deceased female aged 
      22 years (patient A) in Tonkolili District had tested positive for Ebola virus by 
      reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The most recent case of 
      Ebola virus disease (Ebola) in Sierra Leone had been reported 4 months earlier on 
      September 13, 2015 (1), and the World Health Organization had declared the end of 
      Ebola virus transmission in Sierra Leone on November 7, 2015 (2). The Government 
      of Sierra Leone launched a response to prevent further transmission of Ebola 
      virus by identifying contacts of the decedent and monitoring them for Ebola signs 
      and symptoms, ensuring timely treatment for anyone with Ebola, and conducting an 
      epidemiologic investigation to identify the source of infection.

TI  - One-Step Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction for Ebola and Marburg 
      Viruses.
PG  - 205-9
LID - 10.1016/j.phrp.2016.04.004 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ebola and Marburg viruses (EBOVs and MARVs, respectively) are 
      causative agents of severe hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates in humans 
      and nonhuman primates. In 2014, there was a major Ebola outbreak in various 
      countries in West Africa, including Guinea, Liberia, Republic of Sierra Leone, 
      and Nigeria. EBOV and MARV are clinically difficult to diagnose and distinguish 
      from other African epidemic diseases. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to 
      develop a method for rapid identification of the virus to prevent the spread of 
      infection. METHODS: We established a conventional one-step reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for these pathogens based 
      on the Superscript Reverse Transcriptase-Platinum Taq polymerase enzyme mixture. 
      All assays were thoroughly optimized using in vitro-transcribed RNA. RESULTS: We 
      designed seven primer sets of nucleocapsid protein (NP) genes based on sequences 
      from seven filoviruses, including five EBOVs and two MARVs. To evaluate the 
      sensitivity of the RT-PCR assay for each filovirus, 10-fold serial dilutions of 
      synthetic viral RNA transcripts of EBOV or MARV NP genes were used to assess 
      detection limits of viral RNA copies. The potential for these primers to cross 
      react with other filoviruses was also examined. The results showed that the 
      primers were specific for individual genotype detection in the examined 
      filoviruses. CONCLUSION: The assay established in this study may facilitate 
      rapid, reliable laboratory diagnosis in suspected cases of Ebola and Marburg 
      hemorrhagic fevers.

TI  - Lateral Flow Immunoassays for Ebola Virus Disease Detection in Liberia.
PG  - S222-S228
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIs) are point-of-care diagnostic assays 
      that are designed for single use outside a formal laboratory, with in-home 
      pregnancy tests the best-known example of these tests. Although the LFI has some 
      limitations over more-complex immunoassay procedures, such as reduced sensitivity 
      and the potential for false-positive results when using complex sample matrices, 
      the assay has the benefits of a rapid time to result and ease of use. These 
      benefits make it an attractive option for obtaining rapid results in an austere 
      environment. In an outbreak of any magnitude, a field-based rapid diagnostic 
      assay would allow proper patient transport and for safe burials to be conducted 
      without the delay caused by transport of samples between remote villages and 
      testing facilities. Use of such point-of-care instruments in the ongoing Ebola 
      virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa would have distinct advantages in 
      control and prevention of local outbreaks, but proper understanding of the 
      technology and interpretation of results are important. METHODS: In this study, a 
      LFI, originally developed by the Naval Medical Research Center for Ebola virus 
      environmental testing, was evaluated for its ability to detect the virus in 
      clinical samples in Liberia. Clinical blood and plasma samples and post mortem 
      oral swabs submitted to the Liberian Institute for Biomedical Research, the 
      National Public Health Reference Laboratory for EVD testing, were tested and 
      compared to results of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 
      (rRT-PCR), using assays targeting Ebola virus glycoprotein and nucleoprotein. 
      RESULTS: The LFI findings correlated well with those of the real-time RT-PCR 
      assays used as benchmarks. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid antigen-detection tests such as 
      LFIs are attractive alternatives to traditional immunoassays but have reduced 
      sensitivity and specificity, resulting in increases in false-positive and 
      false-negative results. An understanding of the strengths, weaknesses, and 
      limitations of a particular assay lets the diagnostician choose the correct 
      situation to use the correct assay and properly interpret the results.

TI  - [The register of activity at the Ebola treatment center in Forecariah (Guinea) 
      from april 23 to june 5, 2015: analysis and thoughts].
PG  - 272-280
AB  - The register of activity at the Ebola Treatment Center (ETC) in Forecariah 
      (Guinea), from April 23 to June 5, 2015 is presented for analysis. The viral load 
      of each patient is evaluated by the cycle threshold (Ct). One hundred and thirty 
      patients were seen in Triage at the ETC, of which 24 (18.5%) patients who failed 
      to meet theWHO case criteria for viral hemorrhagic fever were excluded from 
      admission to the ETC. Of the 106 patients admitted in the ETC, 72 (67.9%) were 
      declared non-cases after the results of their two PCR (drawn 48 hours apart) 
      tests were negative. Thirty-four patients were tested positive for Ebola virus 
      disease (EVD): 19 women and 15 men (sex ratio: male/female = 0.78), mean age of 
      33.51 +/- 20.1 years (extremes of 42 days to 70 years), of which six children were 
      aged below 8 years. The median initial Ct value was 21.6 +/- 6.3 cycles in this 
      group. Enquiry into patient contacts was only able to identify actual contacts in 
      20 of these patients (58.8%). Thirteen patients were ultimately cured of EVD (six 
      men and seven women) - with a median age of 31.8 years (extremes of 4 to 54 
      years). These patients presented on admission with a median Ct value of 21.88 +/- 
      6.2 cycles (extremes of 17.6 to 31.7). Of the six children aged below 8 years, 
      only one survived. Twenty-one patients (61.76%) with EVD died (9 men and 12 
      women) - median age, 34 +/- 21 years (extremes of 42 days to 70 years). They 
      presented on admission with a median Ct value of 18 +/- 7 cycles (extremes of 12 to 
      24). The single most important factor associated with lethality was the Ct value 
      at the time of admission to the ETC (P = 0.0004), i.e., the lower the Ct value, 
      the higher the lethality rate or simply stated, the higher the viral load, the 
      greater the lethality. Age, sex, identification of contact, and delay between the 
      onset of symptoms and admission did not prove to be predictive of death outcome 
      in our series.

AB  - Ebola virus disease reemerged in Western Africa in 2014. Chinese Center for 
      Disease Control and Prevention dispatched the first Ebola virus (EBOV) detection 
      team to run newly established Sierra Leone-China Friendship Biological Safety 
      Laboratory. The aims of study were to understand epidemiology, clinical 
      manifestations and survival time of EBOV in patient's blood. A total of 913 
      specimens were tested between March 11 and April 20, 2015. EBOV positivity 
      occurred in 7.37% of the blood and 0.53% in throat swabs. Most commonly reported 
      symptoms of laboratory confirmed patients were intense fatigue, anorexia, and 
      fever. EBOV RNAs persisted in blood for almost 4 weeks and the real-time RT-PCR 
      Ct values showed close correlation with the sampling time after onset.

TI  - Deployment of a Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Test 
      for Ebola Virus Surveillance in Remote Areas in Guinea.
PG  - S229-S233
AB  - To strengthen the laboratory diagnostic capacity for Ebola virus disease (EVD) in 
      the remote areas of Guinea, we deployed a mobile field laboratory and implemented 
      reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) for 
      postmortem testing. We tested 896 oral swab specimens and 21 serum samples, using 
      both RT-LAMP and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 
      Neither test yielded a positive result, and the results from RT-LAMP and RT-PCR 
      were consistent. More than 95% of the samples were tested within 2 days of sample 
      collection. These results highlight the usefulness of the RT-LAMP assay as an EVD 
      diagnostic testing method in the field or remote areas.

TI  - Field Validation of the ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of 
      Ebola Virus Infection.
PG  - S203-S209
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic is the 
      largest recorded. Triage on the basis of clinical signs had limited success, and 
      the time to diagnosis by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
      reaction (qRT-PCR) could exceed 5 days. Here we describe the development and 
      field validation of the ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test (ReEBOV RDT) to aid triage of 
      individuals with suspected EVD. METHODS: Samples from patients with suspected EVD 
      were submitted to Kenema Government Hospital, Sierra Leone, for Lassa fever and 
      EVD screening throughout 2014. Banked residual clinical samples were tested in 
      November 2014 and January 2015 in a blinded field trial to estimate the clinical 
      effectiveness of the ReEBOV RDT, compared with EBOV-specific qRT-PCR. RESULTS: 
      Preliminary ReEBOV RDT performance demonstrated a positive percentage agreement 
      (PPA) of 91.1% (195 of 214 results; 95% confidence interval [CI], 86.5%-94.6%) 
      and a negative percentage agreement (NPA) of 90.2% (175 of 194; 95% CI, 
      85.1%-94.0%). The final estimates used by the Food and Drug Administration to 
      determine whether to grant emergency use authorization for the test, which 
      excluded a qRT-PCR reference method threshold cutoff, were a PPA of 62.1% (72 of 
      116 results; 95% CI, 52.6%-70.9%) and a NPA of 96.7% (58 of 60; 95% CI, 
      88.5%-99.6%), with a diagnostic likelihood of 18.6. A subsequent, independent 
      evaluation by the World Health Organization generated results consistent with the 
      preliminary performance estimates. CONCLUSIONS: The ReEBOV RDT demonstrated the 
      potential to provide clinically effective rapid and accurate point-of-care test 
      results and, thus, to be a powerful tool for increasing triage efficiency.

AB  - During July-November 2014, the Democratic Republic of the Congo underwent its 
      seventh Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak. The etiologic agent was Zaire Ebola 
      virus; 66 cases were reported (overall case-fatality rate 74.2%). Through a 
      retrospective observational study of confirmed EVD in 25 patients admitted to 
      either of 2 Ebola treatment centers, we described clinical features and 
      investigated correlates associated with death. Clinical features were mainly 
      generic. At admission, 76% of patients had >1 gastrointestinal symptom and 28% >1 
      hemorrhagic symptom. The case-fatality rate in this group was 48% and was higher 
      for female patients (67%). Cox regression analysis correlated death with initial 
      low cycle threshold, indicating high viral load. Cycle threshold was a robust 
      predictor of death, as were fever, hiccups, diarrhea, dyspnea, dehydration, 
      disorientation, hematemesis, bloody feces during hospitalization, and anorexia in 
      recent medical history. Differences from other outbreaks could suggest guidance 
      for optimizing clinical management and disease control.

TI  - Evaluation of RealStar Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction Kits for 
      Filovirus Detection in the Laboratory and Field.
PG  - S243-S249
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) requires laboratory 
      testing. METHODS: The RealStar Filovirus Screen reverse transcription-polymerase 
      chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit and the derived RealStar Zaire Ebolavirus RT-PCR kit 
      were validated using in vitro transcripts, supernatant of infected cell cultures, 
      and clinical specimens from patients with EVD. RESULTS: The Filovirus Screen kit 
      detected EBOV, Sudan virus, Tai Forest virus, Bundibugyo virus, Reston virus, and 
      Marburg virus and differentiated between the genera Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus 
      The amount of filovirus RNA that could be detected with a probability of 95% 
      ranged from 11 to 67 RNA copies/reaction on a LightCycler 480 II. The Zaire 
      Ebolavirus kit is based on the Filovirus Screen kit but was optimized for 
      detection of EBOV. It has an improved signal-to-noise ratio at low EBOV RNA 
      concentrations and is somewhat more sensitive than the Filovirus kit. Both kits 
      show significantly lower analytical sensitivity on a SmartCycler II. Clinical 
      evaluation revealed that the SmartCycler II, compared with other real-time PCR 
      platforms, decreases the clinical sensitivity of the Filovirus Screen kit to 
      diagnose EVD at an early stage. CONCLUSIONS: The Filovirus Screen kit detects all 
      human-pathogenic filoviruses with good analytical sensitivity if performed on an 
      appropriate real-time PCR platform. High analytical sensitivity is important for 
      early diagnosis of EVD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Nigeria began when an 
      infected diplomat from Liberia arrived in Lagos, the most populous city in 
      Africa, with subsequent transmission to another large city. METHODS: First-, 
      second-, and third-generation contacts were traced, monitored, and classified. 
      Symptomatic contacts were managed at Ebola treatment centers as suspected, 
      probable, and confirmed EVD cases using standard operating procedures adapted 
      from the World Health Organization EVD guidelines. Reverse transcription PCR 
      tests confirmed EVD. Socio-demographic, clinical, hospitalization, and outcome 
      data of the July-September 2014 Nigeria EVD cohort were analyzed. RESULTS: The 
      median age of the 20 EVD cases was 33 years (interquartile range 26-62 years). 
      More females (55%), health workers (65%), and persons <40 years old (60%) were 
      infected than males, non-health workers, and persons aged >/=40 years. No EVD case 
      management worker contracted the disease. Presenting symptoms were fever (85%), 
      fatigue (70%), and diarrhea (65%). Clinical syndromes were gastroenteritis (45%), 
      hemorrhage (30%), and encephalopathy (15%). The case-fatality rate was 40% and 
      there was one mental health complication. The average duration from symptom onset 
      to presentation was 3+/-2 days among survivors and 5+/-2 days for non-survivors. The 
      mean duration from symptom onset to discharge was 15+/-5 days for survivors and 
      11+/-2 days for non-survivors. Mortality was higher in the older age group, males, 
      and those presenting late. CONCLUSION: The EVD outbreak in Nigeria was 
      characterized by the severe febrile gastroenteritis syndrome typical of the West 
      African outbreak, better outcomes, rapid containment, and no infection among EVD 
      care-providers. Early case detection, an effective incident management system, 
      and prompt case management with on-site mobilization and training of local 
      professionals were key to the outcome.

TI  - Ebola Virus Disease Diagnostics, Sierra Leone: Analysis of Real-time Reverse 
      Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction Values for Clinical Blood and Oral Swab 
      Specimens.
PG  - S258-S262
AB  - During the Ebola virus outbreak of 2013-2016, the Viral Special Pathogens Branch 
      field laboratory in Sierra Leone tested approximately 26 000 specimens between 
      August 2014 and October 2015. Analysis of the B2M endogenous control Ct values 
      showed its utility in monitoring specimen quality, comparing results with 
      different specimen types, and interpretation of results. For live patients, blood 
      is the most sensitive specimen type and oral swabs have little diagnostic 
      utility. However, swabs are highly sensitive for diagnostic testing of corpses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ebola virus has been detected in semen of Ebola virus disease 
      survivors after recovery. Liberia's Men's Health Screening Program (MHSP) offers 
      Ebola virus disease survivors semen testing for Ebola virus. We present 
      preliminary results and behavioural outcomes from the first national semen 
      testing programme for Ebola virus. METHODS: The MHSP operates out of three 
      locations in Liberia: Redemption Hospital in Montserrado County, Phebe Hospital 
      in Bong County, and Tellewoyan Hospital in Lofa County. Men aged 15 years and 
      older who had an Ebola treatment unit discharge certificate are eligible for 
      inclusion. Participants' semen samples were tested for Ebola virus RNA by 
      real-time RT-PCR and participants received counselling on safe sexual practices. 
      Participants graduated after receiving two consecutive negative semen tests. 
      Counsellors collected information on sociodemographics and sexual behaviours 
      using questionnaires administered at enrolment, follow up, and graduation visits. 
      Because the programme is ongoing, data analysis was restricted to data obtained 
      from July 7, 2015, to May 6, 2016. FINDINGS: As of May 6, 2016, 466 Ebola virus 
      disease survivors had enrolled in the programme; real-time RT-PCR results were 
      available from 429 participants. 38 participants (9%) produced at least one semen 
      specimen that tested positive for Ebola virus RNA. Of these, 24 (63%) provided 
      semen specimens that tested positive 12 months or longer after Ebola virus 
      disease recovery. The longest interval between discharge from an Ebola treatment 
      unit and collection of a positive semen sample was 565 days. Among participants 
      who enrolled and provided specimens more than 90 days since their Ebola treatment 
      unit discharge, men older than 40 years were more likely to have a semen sample 
      test positive than were men aged 40 years or younger (p=0.0004). 84 (74%) of 113 
      participants who reported not using a condom at enrolment reported using condoms 
      at their first follow-up visit (p<0.0001). 176 (46%) of 385 participants who 
      reported being sexually active at enrolment reported abstinence at their 
      follow-up visit (p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Duration of detection of Ebola virus 
      RNA by real-time RT-PCR varies by individual and might be associated with age. By 
      combining behavioural counselling and laboratory testing, the Men's Health 
      Screening Program helps male Ebola virus disease survivors understand their 
      individual risk and take appropriate measures to protect their sexual partners.

AB  - Bat-borne viral diseases are a major public health concern among newly emerging 
      infectious diseases which includes severe acute respiratory syndrome, Nipah, 
      Marburg and Ebola virus disease. During the survey for Nipah virus among bats at 
      North-East region of India; Tioman virus (TioV), a new member of the 
      Paramyxoviridae family was isolated from tissues of Pteropus giganteus bats for 
      the first time in India. This isolate was identified and confirmed by RT-PCR, 
      sequence analysis and electron microscopy. A range of vertebrate cell lines were 
      shown to be susceptible to Tioman virus. Negative electron microscopy study 
      revealed the "herringbone" morphology of the nucleocapsid filaments and enveloped 
      particles with distinct envelope projections a characteristic of the 
      Paramyxoviridae family. Sequence analysis of Nucleocapsid gene of TioV 
      demonstrated sequence identity of 99.87% and 99.99% nucleotide and amino acid 
      respectively with of TioV strain isolated in Malaysia, 2001. This report 
      demonstrates the first isolation of Tioman virus from a region where Nipah virus 
      activity has been noticed in the past and recent years. Bat-borne viruses have 
      become serious concern world-wide. A Survey of bats for novel viruses in this 
      region would help in recognizing emerging viruses and combating diseases caused 
      by them.

TI  - Implementation of a National Semen Testing and Counseling Program for Male Ebola 
      Survivors - Liberia, 2015-2016.
PG  - 963-6
LID - 10.15585/mmwr.mm6536a5 [doi]
AB  - According to World Health Organization (WHO) data, the Ebola virus disease 
      (Ebola) outbreak that began in West Africa in 2014 has resulted in 28,603 cases 
      and 11,301 deaths (1). In March 2015, epidemiologic investigation and genetic 
      sequencing in Liberia implicated sexual transmission from a male Ebola survivor, 
      with Ebola virus detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 
      (RT-PCR) 199 days after symptom onset (2,3), far exceeding the 101 days reported 
      from an earlier Ebola outbreak (4). In response, WHO released interim guidelines 
      recommending that all male survivors, in addition to receiving condoms and sexual 
      risk reduction counseling at discharge from an Ebola treatment unit (ETU), be 
      offered semen testing for Ebola virus RNA by RT-PCR 3 months after disease onset, 
      and every month thereafter until two consecutive semen specimens collected at 
      least 1 week apart test negative for Ebola virus RNA (5). Male Ebola survivors 
      should also receive counseling to promote safe sexual practices until their semen 
      twice tests negative. When these recommendations were released, testing of semen 
      was not widely available in Liberia. Challenges in establishing and operating the 
      first nationwide semen testing and counseling program for male Ebola survivors 
      included securing sufficient resources for the program, managing a public health 
      semen testing program in the context of ongoing research studies that were also 
      collecting and screening semen, identification of adequate numbers of trained 
      counselors and appropriate health communication messages for the program, 
      overcoming Ebola survivor-associated stigma, identification and recruitment of 
      male Ebola survivors, and operation of mobile teams.

TI  - Analysis of Diagnostic Findings From the European Mobile Laboratory in Gueckedou, 
      Guinea, March 2014 Through March 2015.
PG  - S250-S257
AB  - BACKGROUND: A unit of the European Mobile Laboratory (EMLab) consortium was 
      deployed to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) treatment unit in Gueckedou, Guinea, 
      from March 2014 through March 2015. METHODS: The unit diagnosed EVD and malaria, 
      using the RealStar Filovirus Screen reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
      reaction (RT-PCR) kit and a malaria rapid diagnostic test, respectively. RESULTS: 
      The cleaned EMLab database comprised 4719 samples from 2741 cases of suspected 
      EVD from Guinea. EVD was diagnosed in 1231 of 2178 hospitalized patients (57%) 
      and in 281 of 563 who died in the community (50%). Children aged <15 years had 
      the highest proportion of Ebola virus-malaria parasite coinfections. The 
      case-fatality ratio was high in patients aged <5 years (80%) and those aged >74 
      years (90%) and low in patients aged 10-19 years (40%). On admission, RT-PCR 
      analysis of blood specimens from patients who died in the hospital yielded a 
      lower median cycle threshold (Ct) than analysis of blood specimens from survivors 
      (18.1 vs 23.2). Individuals who died in the community had a median Ct of 21.5 for 
      throat swabs. Multivariate logistic regression on 1047 data sets revealed that 
      low Ct values, ages of <5 and >/=45 years, and, among children aged 5-14 years, 
      malaria parasite coinfection were independent determinants of a poor EVD outcome. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Virus load, age, and malaria parasite coinfection play a role in the 
      outcome of EVD.

TI  - A Randomized, Controlled Trial of ZMapp for Ebola Virus Infection.
PG  - 1448-1456
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data from studies in nonhuman primates suggest that the triple 
      monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp is a promising immune-based treatment for 
      Ebola virus disease (EVD). METHODS: Beginning in March 2015, we conducted a 
      randomized, controlled trial of ZMapp plus the current standard of care as 
      compared with the current standard of care alone in patients with EVD that was 
      diagnosed in West Africa by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. Eligible 
      patients of any age were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the 
      current standard of care or the current standard of care plus three intravenous 
      infusions of ZMapp (50 mg per kilogram of body weight, administered every third 
      day). Patients were stratified according to baseline PCR cycle-threshold value 
      for the virus (</=22 vs. >22) and country of enrollment. Oral favipiravir was part 
      of the current standard of care in Guinea. The primary end point was mortality at 
      28 days. RESULTS: A total of 72 patients were enrolled at sites in Liberia, 
      Sierra Leone, Guinea, and the United States. Of the 71 patients who could be 
      evaluated, 21 died, representing an overall case fatality rate of 30%. Death 
      occurred in 13 of 35 patients (37%) who received the current standard of care 
      alone and in 8 of 36 patients (22%) who received the current standard of care 
      plus ZMapp. The observed posterior probability that ZMapp plus the current 
      standard of care was superior to the current standard of care alone was 91.2%, 
      falling short of the prespecified threshold of 97.5%. Frequentist analyses 
      yielded similar results (absolute difference in mortality with ZMapp, -15 
      percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -36 to 7). Baseline viral load was 
      strongly predictive of both mortality and duration of hospitalization in all age 
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized, controlled trial of a putative 
      therapeutic agent for EVD, although the estimated effect of ZMapp appeared to be 
      beneficial, the result did not meet the prespecified statistical threshold for 
      efficacy. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases 
      and others; PREVAIL II ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02363322 .).

TI  - Clinical presentations and outcomes of patients with Ebola virus disease in 
      Freetown, Sierra Leone.
PG  - 101
LID - 101
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analysed from 
      patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Jui Government Hospital in Freetown, 
      Sierra Leone, where patients with EVD were received and/or treated from October 
      1, 2014 to March 21, 2015 during the West Africa EVD outbreak. METHODS: The study 
      admitted 285 patients with confirmed EVD and followed them up till the endpoint 
      (recovery or death). EVD was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR assays detecting 
      blood Ebola virus (EBOV). RESULTS: Among the 285 lab-confirmed EVD cases in Jui 
      Government Hospital, 146 recovered and 139 died, with an overall survival rate of 
      51.23 %. Patients under the age of 6 years had a lower survival rate (37.50 %). 
      Most non-survivors (79.86 %) died within 7 days after admission and the mean 
      hospitalization time for non-survivors was 5.56 +/- 6.11 days. More than half 
      survivors (63.69 %) turned blood EBOV negative within 3 weeks after admission and 
      the mean hospitalization time for survivors was 20.38 +/- 7.58 days. High blood 
      viral load (>/=10(6) copies/ml) was found to be predictive of the non-survival 
      outcome as indicated by the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve 
      analysis. The probability of patients' survival was less than 15 % when blood 
      viral load was greater than 10(6) copies/ml. Multivariate analyses showed that 
      blood viral load (P = 0.005), confusion (P = 0.010), abdominal pain (P = 0.003), 
      conjunctivitis (P = 0.035), and vomiting (P = 0.004) were factors independently 
      associated with the outcomes of EVD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Most death occurred 
      within 1 week after admission, and patients at the age of 6 or younger had a 
      lower survival rate. Most surviving patients turned blood EBOV negative within 
      1-4 weeks after admission. Factors such as high blood viral load, confusion, 
      abdominal pain, vomiting and conjunctivitis were associated with poor prognosis 
      for EVD patients.

AB  - Ebolavirus, MERS coronavirus and influenza virus are zoonotic RNA viruses, which 
      mutate very rapidly. Viral growth depends on many host factors, but human cells 
      may not provide the ideal growth conditions for viruses invading from nonhuman 
      hosts. The present time-series analyses of short and long oligonucleotide 
      compositions in these genomes showed directional changes in their composition 
      after invasion from a nonhuman host, which are thought to recur after future 
      invasions. In the recent West Africa Ebola outbreak, directional time-series 
      changes in a wide range of oligonucleotides were observed in common for three 
      geographic areas, and the directional changes were observed also for the recent 
      MERS coronavirus epidemics starting in the Middle East. In addition, common 
      directional changes in human influenza A viruses were observed for three 
      subtypes, whose epidemics started independently. Long oligonucleotides that 
      showed an evident directional change observed in common for the three subtypes 
      corresponded to some of influenza A siRNAs, whose activities have been 
      experimentally proven. Predicting directional and reoccurring changes in 
      oligonucleotide composition should become important for designing diagnostic 
      RT-PCR primers and therapeutic oligonucleotides with long effectiveness.

LID - 10.3201/eid2212.161136 [doi]
AB  - By using data from a 2015 clinical trial on Ebola convalescent-phase plasma in 
      Guinea, we assessed the prevalence of electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities at 
      admission and their predictive value to stratify patients into risk groups. 
      Patients underwent testing with a point-of-care device. We used logistic 
      regression to construct a prognostic model and summarized the predictive value 
      with the area under the receiver operating curve. Abnormalities were common among 
      patients, particularly hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hyponatremia, raised 
      creatinine, high anion gap, and anemia. Besides age and PCR cycle threshold 
      value, renal dysfunction, low calcium levels, and low hemoglobin levels were 
      independently associated with increased risk for death. A prognostic model using 
      all 5 factors was highly discriminatory (area under the receiver operating curve 
      0.95; 95% CI 0.90-0.99) and enabled the definition of risk criteria to guide 
      targeted care. Most patients had a very low (<5%) or very high (>80%) risk for 
      death.

TI  - MRPrimerV: a database of PCR primers for RNA virus detection.
PG  - D475-D481
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkw1095 [doi]
AB  - Many infectious diseases are caused by viral infections, and in particular by RNA 
      viruses such as MERS, Ebola and Zika. To understand viral disease, detection and 
      identification of these viruses are essential. Although PCR is widely used for 
      rapid virus identification due to its low cost and high sensitivity and 
      specificity, very few online database resources have compiled PCR primers for RNA 
      viruses. To effectively detect viruses, the MRPrimerV database 
      (http://MRPrimerV.com) contains 152 380 247 PCR primer pairs for detection of 
      1818 viruses, covering 7144 coding sequences (CDSs), representing 100% of the RNA 
      viruses in the most up-to-date NCBI RefSeq database. Due to rigorous similarity 
      testing against all human and viral sequences, every primer in MRPrimerV is 
      highly target-specific. Because MRPrimerV ranks CDSs by the penalty scores of 
      their best primer, users need only use the first primer pair for a single-phase 
      PCR or the first two primer pairs for two-phase PCR. Moreover, MRPrimerV provides 
      the list of genome neighbors that can be detected using each primer pair, 
      covering 22 192 variants of 532 RefSeq RNA viruses. We believe that the public 
      availability of MRPrimerV will facilitate viral metagenomics studies aimed at 
      evaluating the variability of viruses, as well as other scientific tasks.

      where access to conventional microbiological diagnosis is limited. It was used in 
      Sierra Leone to guide management of febrile healthcare workers, in whom Ebola 
      virus disease was a possible cause. In particular, it informed appropriate 
      antibiotic treatment while minimising the risk to clinicians of exposure to the

PG  - 344-350
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiw562 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ebola virus (EBOV) RNA persistence in semen, reported sexual 
      transmission, and sporadic clusters at the end of the 2013-2016 epidemic have 
      prompted recommendations that male survivors refrain from unprotected sex unless 
      their semen is confirmed to be EBOV free. However, there is no fully validated 
      assay for EBOV detection in fluids other than blood. METHODS: The Cepheid Xpert 
      Ebola assay for EBOV RNA detection was validated for whole semen and blood using 
      samples obtained from uninfected donors and spiked with inactivated EBOV. The 
      validation procedure incorporated standards from Clinical and Laboratory 
      Standards Institute and Good Clinical Laboratory Practices guidelines for 
      evaluating molecular devices for use in infectious disease testing. RESULTS: The 
      assay produced limits of detection of 1000 copies/mL in semen and 275 copies/mL 
      in blood. Limits of detection for both semen and blood increased with longer 
      intervals between collection and testing, with acceptable results obtained up to 
      72 hours after specimen collection. CONCLUSIONS: The Cepheid Xpert Ebola assay is 
      accurate and precise for detecting EBOV in whole semen. A validated assay for 
      EBOV RNA detection in semen informs the care of male survivors of Ebola, as well 
      as recommendations for public health.

      threat to the local residents and health care workers. Rapid detection of Ebola 
      virus (EBOV) using RT-PCR has been suggested to be of great value in stopping the 
      outbreak, because it is highly sensitive and specific and can return results 
      within hours. In this study, 210 clinical samples, including 109 blood and 101 
      nasopharyngeal swab samples were used to compare the performance of glycoprotein 
      (GP) and nucleoprotein (NP) gene targets for the detection of EBOV. The 
      analytical sensitivity of both assays were 10 molecules/muL. For clinical samples, 
      the sensitivity of the assay targeting GP gene is higher than that of NP gene 
      (respectively 98% and 94%) and the specificities for both targets were 100%. In 
      addition, the positive samples in the RT-PCR assay targeting GP showed lower 
      cycle threshold values and higher virus loads than NP gene.

AB  - BACKGROUND: By January, 2016, all known transmission chains of the Ebola virus 
      disease (EVD) outbreak in west Africa had been stopped. However, there is concern 
      about persistence of Ebola virus in the reproductive tract of men who have 
      survived EVD. We aimed to use biostatistical modelling to describe the dynamics 
      of Ebola virus RNA load in seminal fluid, including clearance parameters. 
      METHODS: In this longitudinal study, we recruited men who had been discharged 
      from three Ebola treatment units in Guinea between January and July, 2015. 
      Participants provided samples of seminal fluid at follow-up every 3-6 weeks, 
      which we tested for Ebola virus RNA using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. 
      Representative specimens from eight participants were then inoculated into 
      immunodeficient mice to test for infectivity. We used a linear mixed-effect model 
      to analyse the dynamics of virus persistence in seminal fluid over time. 
      FINDINGS: We enrolled 26 participants and tested 130 seminal fluid specimens; 
      median follow up was 197 days (IQR 187-209 days) after enrolment, which 
      corresponded to 255 days (228-287) after disease onset. Ebola virus RNA was 
      detected in 86 semen specimens from 19 (73%) participants. Median duration of 
      Ebola virus RNA detection was 158 days after onset (73-181; maximum 407 days at 
      end of follow-up). Mathematical modelling of the quantitative time-series data 
      showed a mean clearance rate of Ebola virus RNA from seminal fluid of -0.58 log 
      units per month, although the clearance kinetic varied greatly between 
      participants. Using our biostatistical model, we predict that 50% and 90% of male 
      survivors clear Ebola virus RNA from seminal fluid at 115 days (90% prediction 
      interval 72-160) and 294 days (212-399) after disease onset, respectively. We 
      also predicted that the number of men positive for Ebola virus RNA in affected 
      countries would decrease from about 50 in January 2016, to fewer than 1 person by 
      July, 2016. Infectious virus was detected in 15 of 26 (58%) specimens tested in 
      mice. INTERPRETATION: Time to clearance of Ebola virus RNA from seminal fluid 
      varies greatly between individuals and could be more than 13 months. Our 
      predictions will assist in decision-making about surveillance and preventive 
      measures in EVD outbreaks. FUNDING: This study was funded by European Union's 
      Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, Directorate-General for 
      International Cooperation and Development of the European Commission, Institut 
      national de la sante et de la recherche medicale (INSERM), German Research

AB  - The unprecedented 2015 Ebolavirus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa was declared a 
      public health emergency, making diagnosis and quality of testing a global issue. 
      The accuracy of laboratory diagnostic capacity for EBOV was assessed in 2014 to 
      2016 using a proficiency testing (PT) strategy developed by the Royal College of 
      Pathologists of Australasia Quality Assurance Programs (RCPAQAP) in Biosecurity. 
      Following a literature search, EBOV-specific gene targets were ranked according 
      to the frequency of their use in published methods. The most commonly used gene 
      regions (nucleoprotein [NP], glycoprotein [GP], and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 
      [L]) were selected for the design of in vitro RNA transcripts to be included in 
      the simulated EBOV specimens used for EBOV detection with PCR-based assays. 
      Specimens were tested for stability and found to be stable on long-term storage 
      (1 year) at -80 degrees C and on shorter-term storage in lyophilized form (1 week at 
      ambient temperature and a subsequent week at -80 degrees C). These specimens were used in 
      three EBOV PTs offered from April 2014 to March 2016. In the first and third PTs, 
      all laboratories (3/3 and 9/9, respectively) correctly identified specimens 
      containing EBOV RNA transcripts, while in the second PT, all but one laboratory 
      (5/6) correctly confirmed the presence of EBOV. The EBOV PT panel was useful for 
      ensuring the competency of laboratories in detecting EBOV in the absence of 
      readily available clinical samples. The simulated EBOV specimen was safe, stable, 
      and reliable and can be used in lyophilized form for future EBOV PT programs, 
      allowing simplicity of transport.

AB  - PURPOSE: The Ebola outbreak of 2013-2016 severely affected West Africa and 
      resulted in 2544 deaths and 1270 survivors in Guinea, the country where it began. 
      This Ebola virus was the Zaire strain of the virus family Filoviridae. In this 
      outbreak the case fatality rate was about 67%. The survivors, declared cured 
      after 2 negative blood polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results, face psychosocial 
      disorders and rheumatic, ear-nose-throat, neurocognitive, and ophthalmologic 
      complications. The goal of this study was to detect and describe ocular 
      complications afflicting these survivors and to observe their occurrence and 
      recurrences. DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. METHODS: This 
      prospective observational multicenter cohort study was initiated in March 2015. 
      The cohort study included 341 survivors followed up in the infectious disease 
      ward of Conakry, Forecariah, and Nzerekore as of May 2016. The patients received 
      multidisciplinary medical follow-up expected to last at least 1 year that 
      included an eye examination as part of complete, free treatment. RESULTS: 
      Systematic examination of 341 patients revealed 46 cases of uveitis (13.5%), 6 
      cases of episcleritis (1.8%), and 3 cases of interstitial keratitis (0.9%). 
      Uveitis was most frequently unilateral (78.3%) and anterior (47.8%) and occurred 
      within the 2 months after discharge from the Ebola treatment center. Moreover, 
      uveitis relapses were found up to 13 months after the negative PCR result for 
      Ebola in the blood. CONCLUSION: Nearly 1 out of 6 survivors presented ocular 
      disorders after discharge from the Ebola treatment center. An ophthalmologic 
      follow-up for Ebola-infected patients should start, if possible, during the acute 
      phase of the disease and last more than 1 year. Treatment guidelines need to be 
      urgently developed and implemented.

      Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical and virologic characteristics of Ebola virus disease 
      (EVD) in children have not been thoroughly documented. METHODS: Consecutive 
      children aged <18 years with real-time polymerase chain reaction 
      (RT-PCR)-confirmed EVD were enrolled retrospectively in 5 Ebola treatment units 
      in Liberia and Sierra Leone in 2014/2015. Data collection and medical management 
      were based on standardized International Medical Corps protocols. We performed 
      descriptive statistics, multivariate logistic regression, and Kaplan-Meier 
      survival analyses. RESULTS: Of 122 children enrolled, the median age was 7 years 
      and one-third were aged <5 years. The female-to-male ratio was 1.3. The most 
      common clinical features at triage and during hospitalization were fever, 
      weakness, anorexia, and diarrhea, although 21% of patients were initially 
      afebrile and 6 patients remained afebrile. Bleeding was rare at presentation (5%) 
      and manifested subsequently in fewer than 50%. The overall case fatality rate was 
      57%. Factors associated with death in bivariate analyses were age <5 years, 
      bleeding at any time during hospitalization, and high viral load. After 
      adjustment with logistic regression modeling, the odds of death were 14.8-fold 
      higher if patients were aged <5 years, 5-fold higher if the patient had any 
      evidence of bleeding, and 5.2-fold higher if EVD RT-PCR cycle threshold value was 
      </=20. Plasmodium parasitemia had no impact on EVD outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Age <5 
      years, bleeding, and high viral loads were poor prognostic indicators of children 
      with EVD. Research to understand mechanisms of these risk factors and the impact 
      of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance will improve health outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The high number of survivors from the 2013-16 west African outbreak 
      of Ebola virus disease (EVD) has raised several new issues: long-term clinical 
      complications, psychosocial consequences, risks of EVD reactivation, and 
      secondary transmission due to viral persistence in body fluids. We aimed to 
      assess long-term clinical, psychosocial, and viral outcomes in EVD survivors in 
      Guinea. METHODS: In this multidisciplinary observational cohort study, we 
      recruited patients aged 1 year or more in four sites in Guinea (Donka National 
      Hospital, Conakry; Macenta Prefectoral Hospital, Macenta; N'zerekore Regional 
      Hospital, N'zerekore; and Forecariah Prefectoral Hospital, Forecariah) following 
      discharge from any Ebola treatment centre in Guinea. Eligible patients had had 
      laboratory-confirmed EVD and had then been declared clear of the virus in the 
      blood. All consenting patients were included, with no exclusion criteria. Trained 
      clinicians assessed patients at enrolment to the cohort, recording clinical 
      symptoms and signs of depression. We did routine blood examinations and examined 
      viral persistence in body fluids using RT-PCR. We did psychological evaluations 
      using questionnaires developed for different age groups. Follow-up is planned to 
      2 years, and here we present findings at enrolment. FINDINGS: Between March 23, 
      2015, and July 11, 2016, we recruited 802 patients, of whom 360 (45%) were male, 
      442 (55%) were female; 158 (20%) were younger than 18 years. The median age was 
      28.4 years (range 1.0-79.9, IQR 19.4-39.8). The median delay after discharge was 
      350 days (IQR 223-491). The most frequent symptoms were general symptoms (324 
      [40%] patients), musculoskeletal pain (303 [38%]), headache (278 [35%]), 
      depression (124 [17%] of 713 responses), abdominal pain (178 [22%]), and ocular 
      disorders (142 [18%]). More adults than children had at least one clinical 
      symptom (505 [78%] vs 101 [64%], p<0.0003), ocular complications (124 [19%] vs 18 
      [11%], p=0.0200), or musculoskeletal symptoms (274 [43%] vs 29 [18%], p<0.0001). 
      A positive RT-PCR in semen was found in ten (5%) of 188 men, at a maximum of 548 
      days after disease onset. 204 (26%) of 793 patients reported stigmatisation. 
      Ocular complications were more frequent at enrolment than at discharge (142 [18%] 
      vs 61 [8%] patients). INTERPRETATION: Post-EVD symptoms can remain long after 
      recovery and long-term viral persistence in semen is confirmed. The results 
      justify calls for regular check-ups of survivors at least 18 months after 
      recovery. FUNDING: INSERM/Reacting, the French Ebola Task Force, and Institut de 
      Recherche pour le Developpement.

AB  - In the course of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa that was witnessed since early 
      2014, the response mechanisms showed deficits in terms of timeliness, volume and 
      adequacy. The authors were deployed in the Ebola campaign in the West African 
      country Liberia, where by September 2014 the changing epidemiological pattern 
      made reconsiderations of guidelines and adopted procedures necessary. A temporary 
      facility set up as a conventional Ebola Treatment Unit in the Liberian capital 
      Monrovia was re-dedicated into a Severe Infections Temporary Treatment Unit. This 
      facility allowed for stratification based on the nosocomial risk of exposure to 
      Ebola virus for a growing subgroup of admitted patients that in the end would 
      turn out as Ebola negative cases. At the same time, adequate diagnostic measures 
      and treatment for the non-Ebola conditions of these patients could be provided 
      without compromising work safety of the employed staff. The key elements of the 
      new unit comprised a Suspect Cases Area similar to that of conventional Ebola 
      treatment units for newly arriving patients, an Unlikely Cases Area for patients 
      with a first negative Ebola PCR result, and a Confirmed Negative Cases Area for 
      patients in whom Ebola could be ruled out. The authors, comprising 
      representatives of the Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, as well as 
      infectious disease specialists from the German Ebola Task Force are presenting 
      key features of the adapted concept, and are highlighting its relevance in 
      raising acceptance for outbreak counter-measures within the population at stake.

TI  - Asymptomatic infection and unrecognised Ebola virus disease in Ebola-affected 
      households in Sierra Leone: a cross-sectional study using a new non-invasive 
      assay for antibodies to Ebola virus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The frequency of asymptomatic infection with Ebola virus is unclear: 
      previous estimates vary and there is no standard test. Asymptomatic infection 
      with Ebola virus could contribute to population immunity, reducing spread. If 
      people with asymptomatic infection are infectious it could explain re-emergences 
      of Ebola virus disease (EVD) without known contact. METHODS: We validated a new 
      oral fluid anti-glycoprotein IgG capture assay among survivors from Kerry Town 
      Ebola Treatment Centre and controls from communities unaffected by EVD in Sierra 
      Leone. We then assessed the seroprevalence of antibodies to Ebola virus in a 
      cross-sectional study of household contacts of the survivors. All household 
      members were interviewed. Two reactive tests were required for a positive result, 
      with a third test to resolve any discrepancies. FINDINGS: The assay had a 
      specificity of 100% (95% CI 98.9-100; 339 of 339 controls tested negative) and 
      sensitivity of 95.9% (89.8-98.9; 93 of 97 PCR-confirmed survivors tested 
      positive). Of household contacts not diagnosed with EVD, 47.6% (229 of 481) had 
      high level exposure (direct contact with a corpse, body fluids, or a case with 
      diarrhoea, vomiting, or bleeding). Among the contacts, 12.0% (95% CI 6.1-20.4; 11 
      of 92) with symptoms at the time other household members had EVD, and 2.6% 
      (1.2-4.7; 10 of 388) with no symptoms tested positive. Among asymptomatic 
      contacts, seropositivity was weakly correlated with exposure level. 
      INTERPRETATION: This new highly specific and sensitive assay showed asymptomatic 
      infection with Ebola virus was uncommon despite high exposure. The low prevalence 
      suggests asymptomatic infection contributes little to herd immunity in Ebola, and 
      even if infectious, would account for few transmissions. FUNDING: Wellcome Trust

AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2014-15 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic strained health 
      systems in west Africa already overburdened with other diseases, including 
      malaria. Because EVD and malaria can be difficult to distinguish clinically, and 
      rapid testing was not available in many Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs), guidelines 
      recommended empirical malaria treatment. Little is known, however, about the 
      prevalence and characteristics of patients entering an ETU who were infected with 
      malaria parasites, either alone or concurrently with Ebola virus. METHODS: Data 
      for sociodemographics, disease characteristics, and mortality were analysed for 
      patients with suspected EVD admitted to three ETUs in Sierra Leone using a 
      retrospective cohort design. Testing for Ebola virus was done by real-time PCR 
      and for malaria by a rapid diagnostic test. Characteristics of patients were 
      compared and survival analyses were done to evaluate the effect of infection 
      status on mortality. FINDINGS: Between Dec 1, 2014, and Oct 15, 2015, 1524 cases 
      were treated at the three ETUs for suspected EVD, of whom 1368 (90%) had 
      diagnostic data for malaria and EVD. Median age of patients was 29 years (IQR 
      20-44) and 715 (52%) were men. 1114 patients were EVD negative, of whom 365 (33%) 
      tested positive for malaria. Of 254 EVD positive patients, 53 (21%) also tested 
      positive for malaria. Mortality risk was highest in patients diagnosed with both 
      EVD and malaria (35 [66%] of 53 died) and patients diagnosed with EVD alone (105 
      [52%] of 201 died). Compared with patients presenting to ETUs without malaria or 
      EVD, mortality was increased in the malaria positive and EVD positive group 
      (adjusted hazard ratio 9.36, 95% CI 6.18-14.18, p<0.0001), and the malaria 
      negative and EVD positive group (5.97, 4.44-8.02, p<0.0001), but reduced in the 
      malaria positive and EVD negative group (0.37, 0.20-1.23, p=0.0010). 
      INTERPRETATION: Malaria parasite co-infection was common in patients presenting 
      to ETUs and conferred an increased mortality risk in patients infected with Ebola 
      virus, supporting empirical malaria treatment in ETUs. The high mortality among 
      patients without EVD or malaria suggests expanded testing and treatment might 
      improve care in future EVD epidemics. FUNDING: International Medical Corps.

AB  - Urine samples are increasingly used for diagnosing infections including 
      Escherichia coli, Ebola virus, and Zika virus. However, extraction and 
      concentration of nucleic acid biomarkers from urine is necessary for many 
      molecular detection strategies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Since 
      urine samples typically have large volumes with dilute biomarker concentrations 
      making them prone to false negatives, another impediment for urine-based 
      diagnostics is the establishment of appropriate controls particularly to rule out 
      false negatives. In this study, a mouse glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
      (GAPDH) DNA target was added to retrospectively collected urine samples from 
      tuberculosis (TB)-infected and TB-uninfected patients to indicate extraction of 
      intact DNA and removal of PCR inhibitors from urine samples. We tested this 
      design on surrogate urine samples, retrospective 1milliliter (mL) urine samples 
      from patients in Lima, Peru and retrospective 5mL urine samples from patients in 
      Cape Town, South Africa. Extraction/PCR control DNA was detectable in 97% of 
      clinical samples with no statistically significant differences among groups. 
      Despite the inclusion of this control, there was no difference in the amount of 
      TB IS6110 Tr-DNA detected between TB-infected and TB-uninfected groups except for 
      samples from known HIV-infected patients. We found an increase in TB IS6110 
      Tr-DNA between TB/HIV co-infected patients compared to TB-uninfected/HIV-infected 
      patients (N=18, p=0.037). The inclusion of an extraction/PCR control DNA to 
      indicate successful DNA extraction and removal of PCR inhibitors should be easily 
      adaptable as a sample preparation control for other acellular sample types.

AB  - This study modeled the presence of Ebola virus RNA in the semen of male Ebola 
      survivors participating in the Postebogui study in Guinea. The median time of 
      reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction negativity was 46.4 days after 
      symptom onset (95% confidence interval, 11-82.6). The results emphasize the 
      importance of the World Health Organization recommendations for survivors' 
      management.

AB  - Given that Ebola virus causes severe hemorrhagic fever in humans with mortality 
      rates as high as 90%, rapid and accurate detection of this virus is essential 
      both for controlling infection and preventing further transmission. Here, a 
      one-step qRT-PCR assay for rapid and quantitative detection of an Ebola Zaire 
      strain using GP, VP24 or VP40 genes as a target is introduced. Routine assay 
      conditions for hydrolysis probe detection were established from the 
      manufacturer's protocol used in the assays. The analytical specificity and 
      sensitivity of each assay was evaluated using in vitro synthesized viral RNA 
      transcripts. The assays were highly specific for the RNA transcripts, no 
      cross-reactivity being observed among them. The limits of detection of the assays 
      ranged from 10(2) to 10(3) copies per reaction. The assays were also evaluated 
      using viral RNAs extracted from cell culture-propagated viruses (Ebola Zaire, 
      Sudan and Reston strains), confirming that they are gene- and strain-specific. 
      The RT-PCR assays detected viral RNAs in blood samples from virus-infected 
      animal, suggesting that they can be also a useful method for identifying Ebola 
      virus in clinical samples.

AB  - BACKGROUND. The pathogenesis of Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) is poorly 
      characterized. The establishment of well-equipped diagnostic laboratories close 
      to Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) has made it possible to obtain relevant 
      virological and biological data during the course of EVD and to assess their 
      association with the clinical course and different outcomes of the disease. 
      METHODS. We were responsible for diagnosing EBOV infection in patients admitted 
      to two ETCs in forested areas of Guinea. The pattern of clinical signs was 
      recorded, and an etiological diagnosis was established by RT-PCR for EBOV 
      infection or a rapid test for malaria and typhoid fever. Biochemical analyses 
      were also performed. RESULTS. We handled samples from 168 patients between 
      November 29, 2014, and January 31, 2015; 97 patients were found to be infected 
      with EBOV, with Plasmodium falciparum coinfection in 18%. Overall mortality for 
      EVD cases was 58%, rising to 86% if P. falciparum was also present. Viral load 
      was higher in fatal cases of EVD than in survivors, and fatal cases were 
      associated with higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine 
      aminotransferase (ALT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and IL-6 levels. Furthermore, 
      regardless of outcome, EVD was characterized by higher creatine kinase (CPK), 
      amylase, and creatinine levels than in febrile patients without EVD, with higher 
      blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in fatal cases of EVD only. CONCLUSION. These 
      findings suggest that a high viral load at admission is a marker of poor EVD 
      prognosis. In addition, high AST, ALT, CRP, and IL-6 levels are associated with a 
      fatal outcome of EVD. Damage to the liver and other tissues, with massive 
      rhabdomyolysis and, probably, acute pancreatitis, is associated with EVD and 
      correlated with disease severity. Finally, biochemical analyses provide 
      substantial added value at ETCs, making it possible to improve supportive 
      rehydration and symptomatic care for patients. FUNDING. The French Ministry of 
      Foreign Affairs, the Agence Francaise de Developpement, and Institut Pasteur.

AB  - Ebola virus disease (EVD), a highly virulent infectious disease caused by 
      ebolaviruses, has a fatality rate of 25-90%. Without a licensed chemotherapeutic 
      agent or vaccine for the treatment and prevention of EVD, control of outbreaks 
      requires accurate and rapid diagnosis of cases. In this study, five sets of six 
      oligonucleotide primers targeting the nucleoprotein gene were designed for 
      specific identification of each of the five ebolavirus species using reverse 
      transcription-loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay. The 
      detection limits of the ebolavirus species-specific primer sets were evaluated 
      using in vitro transcribed RNAs. The detection limit of species-specific RT-LAMP 
      assays for Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Tai Forest ebolavirus, and 
      Bundibugyo ebolavirus was 256 copies/reaction, while the detection limit for 
      Reston ebolavirus was 64 copies/reaction, and the detection time for each of the 
      RT-LAMP assays was 13.3+/-3.0, 19.8+/-4.6, 14.3+/-0.6, 16.1+/-4.7, and 19.8+/-2.4min 
      (mean+/-SD), respectively. The sensitivity of the species-specific RT-LAMP assays 
      were similar to that of the established RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR assays for 
      diagnosis of EVD and are suitable for field or point-of-care diagnosis. The 
      RT-LAMP assays were specific for the detection of the respective species of 
      ebolavirus with no cross reaction with other species of ebolavirus and other 
      viral hemorrhagic fever viruses such as Marburg virus, Lassa fever virus, and 
      Dengue virus. The species-specific RT-LAMP assays developed in this study are 
      rapid, sensitive, and specific and could be useful in case of an EVD outbreak.

TI  - Group A Rotaviruses in Chinese Bats: Genetic Composition, Serology, and Evidence 
      for Bat-to-Human Transmission and Reassortment.
LID - 10.1128/JVI.02493-16 [doi]
LID - e02493-16
AB  - Bats are natural reservoirs for many pathogenic viruses, and increasing evidence 
      supports the notion that bats can also harbor group A rotaviruses (RVAs), 
      important causative agents of diarrhea in children and young animals. Currently, 
      8 RVA strains possessing completely novel genotype constellations or genotypes 
      possibly originating from other mammals have been identified from African and 
      Chinese bats. However, all the data were mainly based on detection of RVA RNA, 
      present only during acute infections, which does not permit assessment of the 
      true exposure of a bat population to RVA. To systematically investigate the 
      genetic diversity of RVAs, 547 bat anal swabs or gut samples along with 448 bat 
      sera were collected from five South Chinese provinces. Specific reverse 
      transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) screening found four RVA strains. Strain GLRL1 
      possessed a completely novel genotype constellation, whereas the other three 
      possessed a constellation consistent with the MSLH14-like genotype, a newly 
      characterized group of viruses widely prevalent in Chinese insectivorous bats. 
      Among the latter, strain LZHP2 provided strong evidence of cross-species 
      transmission of RVAs from bats to humans, whereas strains YSSK5 and BSTM70 were 
      likely reassortants between typical MSLH14-like RVAs and human RVAs. RVA-specific 
      antibodies were detected in 10.7% (48/448) of bat sera by an indirect 
      immunofluorescence assay (IIFA). Bats in Guangxi and Yunnan had a higher 
      RVA-specific antibody prevalence than those from Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. 
      These observations provide evidence for cross-species transmission of MSLH14-like 
      bat RVAs to humans, highlighting the impact of bats as reservoirs of RVAs on 
      public health.IMPORTANCE Bat viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola, Hendra, and Nipah 
      viruses, are important pathogens causing outbreaks of severe emerging infectious 
      diseases. However, little is known about bat viruses capable of causing 
      gastroenteritis in humans, even though 8 group A viruses (RVAs) have been 
      identified from bats so far. In this study, another 4 RVA strains were 
      identified, with one providing strong evidence for zoonotic transmission from 
      bats to humans. Serological investigation has also indicated that RVA infection 
      in bats is far more prevalent than expected based on the detection of viral RNA.

TI  - Microbiological quality of water in a city with persistent and recurrent 
      waterborne diseases under tropical sub-rural conditions: The case of Kikwit City, 
      Democratic Republic of the Congo.

AB  - The availability of safe drinking water in sub-Saharan countries remains a major 
      challenge because poor sanitation has been the cause of various outbreaks of 
      waterborne disease due to the poor microbiological quality of water used for 
      domestic purposes. The faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) used in the present study 
      included Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Enterococcus (ENT). FIB and aerobic 
      mesophilic bacteria (AMB) were quantified during July 2015 (dry season) and 
      November 2015 (rainy season) in order to assess the quality of drinking water 
      from wells (n=3; P1-P3), and two rivers, the River Lukemi (RLK, n=3) and River 
      Luini (RLN, n=2) in the city of Kikwit, which is located in the province of Kwilu 
      in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Kikwit is well known for its outbreaks 
      of persistent and recurrent waterborne diseases including Entamoeba, Shigella, 
      typhoid fever, cholera, and Ebola Viral Hemorrhagic Fever. Consequently, E. coli, 
      ENT, and AMB were quantified in water samples according to the standard 
      international methods for water quality determination using the membrane 
      filtration method. The FIB characterization was performed for human-specific 
      Bacteroides by PCR using specific primers. The results obtained revealed high FIB 
      concentrations in river samples collected during both seasons. For example, E. 
      coli respectively reached 4.3x10(4) and 9.2x10(4) CFU 100mL(-1) in the dry season 
      and the wet season. ENT reached 5.3x10(3) CFU 100mL(-1) during the dry season and 
      9.8x10(3) CFU 100mL(-1) in the wet season. The pollution was significantly worse 
      in the wet season compared to the dry season. Surprisingly, no faecal 
      contamination was observed in well water samples collected in the dry season 
      while E. coli and ENT were detected in all wells in the wet season with values of 
      6, 7, and 11CFUmL(-1) for E. coli in wells P1-P3, respectively and 3, 5, 9 CFU 
      mL(-1)for ENT in the same wells. Interestingly, the PCR assays for human-specific 
      Bacteroides HF183/HF134 indicated that 97-100% captured in all analyses of 
      isolated FIB were of human origin. The results indicate that contamination of E. 
      coli, ENT, and AMB in the studied water resources increases during the wet 
      season. This study improves understanding of the microbiological pollution of 
      rivers and wells under tropical conditions and will guide future municipal/local 
      government decisions on improving water quality in this region which is 
      characterised by persistent and recurrent waterborne diseases. Although the 
      epidemiology can be geographically localised, the effects of cross border 
      transmission can be global. Therefore, the research results presented in this 
      article form recommendations to municipalities/local authorities and the approach 
      and procedures can be carried out in a similar environment.

AB  - Development of vaccines against highly pathogenic viruses that could also be used 
      as agents of bioterrorism is both a public health issue and a national security 
      priority. Methods that can quantify neutralizing antibodies will likely be 
      crucial in demonstrating vaccine effectiveness, as most licensed viral vaccines 
      are effective due to their capacity to elicit neutralizing antibodies. Assays to 
      determine whether antibodies are neutralizing traditionally involve infectious 
      virus, and the assay most commonly used is the plaque-reduction neutralization 
      test (PRNT). However, when the virus is highly pathogenic, this assay must be 
      done under the appropriate level of containment; for tier one select agents, such 
      as Ebola virus (EBOV), it is performed under Biological Safety Level 4 (BSL-4) 
      conditions. Developing high-throughput neutralization assays for these viruses 
      that can be done in standard BSL-2 laboratories should facilitate vaccine 
      development. Our approach is to use a replication-competent hybrid virus whose 
      genome carries the envelope gene from the pathogenic virus on the genetic 
      backbone of a non-pathogenic virus, such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). We 
      have generated hybrid VSVs carrying the envelope genes for several species of 
      ebolavirus. The readout for infectivity is a one-step reverse transcriptase 
      quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), an approach that we have used for other viruses that 
      allows robustness and adaptability to automation. Using this method, we have 
      shown that neutralization can be assessed within 6-16h after infection. 
      Importantly, the titers obtained in our assay with two characterized antibodies 
      were in agreement with titers obtained in other assays. Finally, although in this 
      paper we describe the VSV platform to quantify neutralizing antibodies to 
      ebolaviruses, the platform should be directly applicable to any virus whose 
      envelope is compatible with VSV biology.

TI  - Lessons learned by surveillance during the tail-end of the Ebola outbreak in 
      Guinea, June-October 2015: a case series.

AB  - BACKGROUND: By the end of the 2013-2016 West African Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) 
      outbreaks, a total of 3814 cases (probable and confirmed) and 2544 deaths were 
      reported in Guinea. Clearly, surveillance activities aiming at stopping 
      human-to-human transmission have been the breakthrough of EVD outbreak 
      management, but their application has been at times easier said than done. This 
      article presents five confirmed or probable EVD cases that arose in Conakry 
      towards the end of the Guinea epidemic, which demonstrate flaws in surveillance 
      and follow-up. CASE PRESENTATION: For case 1, safe burial requirements were not 
      followed. For cases 1 and 2, negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) results 
      were interpreted as no infection. For the first case, the sample may have not 
      been taken properly while for the second the disease was possibly at its early 
      stage. Case 3 was stopped at a border health checkpoint and despite her high 
      temperature she was allowed to continue the bus journey. For case 4, an oral swab 
      sample was supposedly taken after death but could not be found for retrospective 
      testing. Despite characteristic symptomatology, case 5 was not identified as a 
      suspect case for as long as 3 weeks. CONCLUSION: In epidemic contexts, health 
      systems must be able to track all samples of suspect cases and deaths, regardless 
      of their laboratory results. Social mobilization in communities and training in 
      health care facilities must be strengthened at the tail of an outbreak, to avoid 
      the natural slackening of disease surveillance, in particular for long-lasting 
      and deadly epidemics.

AB  - During the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa several international mobile 
      laboratories were deployed to the mainly affected countries Guinea, Sierra Leone 
      and Liberia to provide ebolavirus diagnostic capacity. Additionally, imported 
      cases and small outbreaks in other countries required global preparedness for 
      Ebola diagnostics. Detection of viral RNA by reverse transcription polymerase 
      chain reaction has proven effective for diagnosis of ebolavirus disease and 
      several assays are available. However, reliability of these assays is largely 
      unknown and requires serious evaluation. Therefore, a proficiency test panel of 
      11 samples was generated and distributed on a global scale. Panels were analyzed 
      by 83 expert laboratories and 106 data sets were returned. From these 78 results 
      were rated optimal and 3 acceptable, 25 indicated need for improvement. While 
      performance of the laboratories deployed to West Africa was superior to the 
      overall performance there was no significant difference between the different 
      assays applied.

AB  - Between August-December 2014, Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) patients from Tonkolili 
      District were referred for care to two Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) Ebola 
      Management Centres (EMCs) outside the district (distant EMCs). In December 2014, 
      MSF opened an EMC in Tonkolili District (district EMC). We examined the effect of 
      opening a district-based EMC on time to admission and number of suspect cases 
      dead on arrival (DOA), and identified factors associated with fatality in EVD 
      patients, residents in Tonkolili District. Residents of Tonkolili district who 
      presented between 12 September 2014 and 23 February 2015 to the district EMC and 
      the two distant EMCs were identified from EMC line-lists. EVD cases were 
      confirmed by a positive Ebola PCR test. We calculated time to admission since the 
      onset of symptoms, case-fatality and adjusted Risk Ratios (aRR) using Binomial 
      regression. Of 249 confirmed Ebola cases, 206 (83%) were admitted to the distant 
      EMCs and 43 (17%) to the district EMC. Of them 110 (45%) have died. Confirmed 
      cases dead on arrival (n = 10) were observed only in the distant EMCs. The median 
      time from symptom onset to admission was 6 days (IQR 4,8) in distant EMCs and 3 
      days (IQR 2,7) in the district EMC (p<0.001). Cases were 2.0 (95%CI 1.4-2.9) 
      times more likely to have delayed admission (>3 days after symptom onset) in the 
      distant compared with the district EMC, but were less likely (aRR = 0.8; 95%CI 
      0.6-1.0) to have a high viral load (cycle threshold </=22). A fatal outcome was 
      associated with a high viral load (aRR 2.6; 95%CI 1.8-3.6) and vomiting at first 
      presentation (aRR 1.4; 95%CI 1.0-2.0). The opening of a district EMC was 
      associated with earlier admission of cases to appropriate care facilities, an 
      essential component of reducing EVD transmission. High viral load and vomiting at 
      admission predicted fatality. Healthcare providers should consider the location 
      of EMCs to ensure equitable access during Ebola outbreaks.

AB  - The most performing techniques enabling early diagnosis of infectious diseases 
      rely on nucleic acid detection. Today, because of their high technicality and 
      cost, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) are of benefit only to a small 
      fraction of developing countries population. By reducing costs, simplifying 
      procedures and enabling multiplexing, paper microfluidics has the potential to 
      considerably facilitate their accessibility. However, most of the studies 
      performed in this area have not quit the lab. This letter brings NAAT on paper 
      closer to the field, by using clinical samples and operating in a 
      resource-limited setting. We first performed isothermal reverse transcription and 
      Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RT-RPA) of synthetic Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) 
      of Ebola virus using paper microfluidics devices. We further applied this method 
      in Guinea to detect the presence of Ebola virus in human sample RNA extracts, 
      with minimal facilities (carry-on detection device and freeze-dried reagents on 
      paper). RT-RPA results were available in few minutes and demonstrate a 
      sensitivity of 90.0% compared to the gold-standard RT-PCR on a set of 43 patient 
      samples. Furthermore, the realization of a nine-spot multilayered device 
      achieving the parallel detection of three distinct RNA sequences opens a route 
      toward the detection of multiple viral strains or pathogens.

TI  - THE STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, OPPORTUNITIES, AND THREATS (SWOTs) ANALYSES OF THE 
      EBOLA VIRUS - PAPER RETRACTED.
PG  - 69-88
LID - 10.21010/ajid.v10i2.2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Owing to the extreme virulence and case fatality rate of ebola virus 
      disease (EVD), there had been so much furore, panic and public health emergency 
      about the possible pandemic from the recent West African outbreak of the disease, 
      with attendant handful research, both in the past and most recently. The 
      magnitude of the epidemic of ebola virus disease has prompted global interest and 
      urgency in the discovery of measures to mitigate the impact of the disease. 
      Researchers in the academia and the industry were pressured to only focus on the 
      development of effective and safe ebola virus vaccines, without consideration of 
      the other aspects to this virus, which may influence the success or otherwise of 
      a potential vaccine. The objective of this review was to adopt the SWOT concept 
      to elucidate the biological Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats to 
      Ebola virus as a pathogen, with a view to understanding and devising holistic 
      strategies at combating and overcoming the scourge of EVD. METHOD: This 
      systematic review and narrative synthesis utilized Medline, PubMed, Google and 
      other databases to select about 150 publications on ebola and ebola virus disease 
      using text word searches to generate the specific terms. Relevant publications 
      were reviewed and compared, findings were synthesized using a narrative method 
      and summarized qualitatively. RESULTS: Some of the identified strengths of ebola 
      virus include: Ebola virus is an RNA virus with inherent capability to mutate, 
      reassort and recombine to generate mutant or reassortant virulent strains; Ebola 
      virus has a broad cellular tropism; Natural Reservoir of ebola virus is 
      unconfirmed but fruit bats, arthropods, and plants are hypothesized; Ebola virus 
      primarily targets and selectively destroys the immune system; Ebola viruses 
      possess accessory proteins that inhibits the host' immune responses; Secreted 
      glycoprotein (sGP), a truncated soluble protein that triggers immune activation 
      and increased vascular permeability is uniquely associated with Ebola virus only; 
      Ability to effectively cross the species barrier and establish productive 
      infection in humans, non human primates, and other mammals; Ebola virus attacks 
      every part of the human body; The Weaknesses include: Ebola virus transmission 
      and persistence is severely limited by its virulence; Ebola virus essentially 
      requires host encoded protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) for host's cell' entry; 
      Ebola virus essentially requires host encoded proteins (TIM-1) for cell' entry; 
      Relative abundance of Ebolavirus Nucleoprotein than the other virion components; 
      The Opportunities harnessed by ebola virus include: Lack of infection control 
      practices in African health-care facilities and paucity of health 
      infrastructures, especially in the endemic zones; Permissiveness of circulating 
      Monocytes, Macrophages and dendritic cells in virus mobilization and 
      dissemination; Collection, consumption and trade of wild games (bushmeats); 
      Pertubation and drastic changes in forest ecosystems present opportunities for 
      Ebola virus; Use of dogs in hunting predisposes man and animals to inter-species 
      contact; Poverty, malnutrition, crowding, social disorder, mobility and political 
      instability; Ease of travel and aviation as potentials for global spread; 
      Possible mechanical transmission by arthropod vectors; No vaccines or 
      therapeutics are yet approved for human treatment; The Threats to ebola virus 
      include: Avoidance of direct contact with infected blood and other bodily fluids 
      of infected patient; Appropriate and correct burial practices; Adoption of 
      barrier Nursing; Improved surveillance to prevent potential spread of epidemic; 
      Making Available Rapid laboratory equipment and procedures for prompt detection 
      (ELISA, Western Blot, PCR); Sterilization or disinfection of equipment and safe 
      disposal of instrument; Prompt hospitalization, isolation and quarantine of 
      infected individual; Active contact tracing and monitoring, among others. 
      CONCLUSION: The identified capacities and gaps presented in this study are 
      inexhaustive framework to combat the ebola virus. To undermine and overcome the 
      virus, focus should be aimed at strategically decreasing the identified strengths 
      and opportunities, while increasing on the weaknesses of, and threats to the 
      virus.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Health care workers (HCWs) in contact with patients with Ebola virus 
      disease (EVD) are exposed to a risk of viral contamination. Fomites contaminated 
      with the patient's blood or body fluids represents this risk. Our study aims to 
      detect Ebola virus (EBOV) RNA within the high- and low-risk areas of an Ebola 
      treatment unit (ETU) located in inland Guinea during the 2014-2015 West African 
      Ebola epidemics. For samples from patients' immediate vicinity, we aim to seek an 
      association between viral RNA detectability and level of plasma viral load of 
      patients (intermediate to high, or very high). METHODS: Swabbing was performed on 
      immediate vicinity of Ebola patients, on surfaces of an ETU, and on personal 
      protective equipment (PPE) of HCWs after patient care and prior to doffing. All 
      samples were assessed by quantitative reverse-transcribed PCR (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: 
      32% (22/68) of swabs from high-risk areas were tested positive for EBOV RNA, 
      including 42% (18/43) from patients' immediate vicinity, and 16% (4/25) from HCWs 
      PPE. None of specimens from low-risk areas were tested positive (0/19). Swabs 
      were much more often viral RNA positive in the vicinity of patients with a very 
      high plasma viral load (OR 6.7, 95% CI [1.7-23.4]). CONCLUSION: Our findings show 
      the persistence of EBOV RNA in the environment of Ebola patients and of HCWs, in 
      a Guinean ETU, despite strict infection prevention and control measures. This 
      detection raises the possibility that patients' environment could be a potential 
      source of contamination with the virus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ebola virus emerged in West Africa in December 2013. The high 
      population mobility and poor public health infrastructure in this region led to 
      the development of the largest Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak to date. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: On September 26, 2014, China dispatched a Mobile 
      Biosafety Level-3 Laboratory (MBSL-3 Lab) and a well-trained diagnostic team to 
      Sierra Leone to assist in EVD diagnosis using quantitative real-time PCR, which 
      allowed the diagnosis of suspected EVD cases in less than 4 hours from the time 
      of sample receiving. This laboratory was composed of three container vehicles 
      equipped with advanced ventilation system, communication system, electricity and 
      gas supply system. We strictly applied multiple safety precautions to reduce 
      exposure risks. Personnel, materials, water and air flow management were the key 
      elements of the biosafety measures in the MBSL-3 Lab. Air samples were regularly 
      collected from the MBSL-3 Lab, but no evidence of Ebola virus infectious aerosols 
      was detected. Potentially contaminated objects were also tested by collecting 
      swabs. On one occasion, a pipette tested positive for EVD. A total of 1,635 
      suspected EVD cases (824 positive [50.4%]) were tested from September 28 to 
      November 11, 2014, and no member of the diagnostic team was infected with Ebola 
      virus or other pathogens, including Lassa fever. The specimens tested included 
      blood (69.2%) and oral swabs (30.8%) with positivity rates of 54.2% and 41.9%, 
      respectively. The China mobile laboratory was thus instrumental in the EVD 
      outbreak response by providing timely and reliable diagnostics. 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The MBSL-3 Lab significantly contributed to 
      establishing a suitable laboratory response capacity during the emergence of EVD 
      in Sierra Leone.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The recent West Africa Ebola outbreak highlighted the need to provide 
      access to rapid, safe and reliable Ebola Virus Disease diagnostics. OBJECTIVES: 
      The objective of this field study was to assess the clinical performance of the 
      FilmArray((R)) BioThreat-E test for the detection of Ebola Zaire virus in whole 
      blood in symptomatic patients suspected of Ebola Virus Disease in Conakry 
      (Guinea) from March to July 2015. STUDY DESIGN: The BioThreat-E test was compared 
      to the two RT-PCRs, using serum, implemented at Donka Hospital in the emergency 
      context: an in-house developed quantitative one-step RT-PCR adapted from the 
      Weidmann technique, and the RealStar((R)) Filovirus RT-PCR Kit 1.0 
      (Altona-Diagnostics). We also assessed the performance of this assay in 
      noninvasive specimens (urine and saliva) to detect infected patients. RESULTS: Of 
      135 patients enrolled and eligible for performance assessment on whole blood, the 
      sensitivity was 95.7% [95% CI: 85.5-99.5] and specificity 100% [95% CI: 
      95.9-100]. Of the 37 symptomatic infected patients able to provide saliva and/or 
      urine samples, 34 of the 35 saliva samples and all 3 of the urine samples were 
      positive with the BioThreat-E test. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the 
      FilmArray BioThreat-E test performs comparably to conventional molecular tests 
      under field conditions, providing results and interpretation in approximately 1h. 
      Due to its operational characteristics, it can be easily deployed in the field 
      during an epidemic and could also be a useful tool for post-outbreak 
      surveillance.

      and assess protein-protein interactions; however, they can also be used to assess 
      protein-RNA complexes. Here we describe an adapted RNA immunoprecipitation 
      technique that permits the quantification of RNA content in Ebola virus 
      nucleocapsids that have been reconstituted in vitro by transient transfection.

      Disease by RT-PCR.
PG  - 321-337
LID - 10.1007/978-1-4939-7116-9_26 [doi]
AB  - Ebola virus (EBOV) disease is a severe, acute human syndrome associated with high 
      case fatality rates. Immune responses to EBOV are thought to be at least 
      partially responsible for disease pathogenesis and must therefore be investigated 
      to get a better understanding of underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis. Syrian 
      hamsters are susceptible to EBOV infection and develop a disease more consistent 
      with human EBOV disease than other rodent disease models. Quantitative RT-PCR 
      (qRT-PCR) is ideal for monitoring immune responses during EBOV infection in low- 
      to medium-throughput applications. A relatively straightforward protocol for 
      monitoring immune responses, based on information gleaned from experimental EBOV 
      infection of hamsters, is presented.

AB  - Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based techniques allow 
      for highly sensitive and specific detection of RNA viruses. Detection of the 
      amplification products can be achieved using several methods. The following are 
      descriptions of the detection of ebolavirus RNA using end-point RT-PCR (agarose 
      gel visualization of amplification products) and quantitative RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR), 
      with fluorescent detection using an intercalating dye or detection with the use 
      of 5' hydrolysis probe assays. All of these techniques can be used to accurately 
      detect the presence of ebolavirus in samples.

AB  - Sampling wildlife for ebolaviruses presents the researcher with a multitude of 
      challenges, foremost of which is safety. Throughout the methods described in this 
      chapter, personal safety and personal protective equipment (PPE) will be 
      reiterated for each methodology. The methods described here are those used to 
      successfully detect and isolate marburgviruses from their natural reservoir, 
      Rousettus aegyptiacus, and therefore should be applicable for diagnostic testing 
      for ebolaviruses via RT-PCR, ELISA, and IHC techniques.Although an ebolavirus 
      natural reservoir has yet to be identified, the majority of disease ecologists 
      believe the reservoir to belong to the order Chiroptera (bats). The methods 
      presented in this chapter are presented with bats as an example, but all of these 
      methods would be applicable to other species of wildlife with few or no 
      modifications.

PG  - 1077-1083
LID - 10.1017/ice.2017.121 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE To evaluate healthcare worker (HCW) risk of self-contamination when 
      donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE) using fluorescence and 
      MS2 bacteriophage. DESIGN Prospective pilot study. SETTING Tertiary-care 
      hospital. PARTICIPANTS A total of 36 HCWs were included in this study: 18 
      donned/doffed contact precaution (CP) PPE and 18 donned/doffed Ebola virus 
      disease (EVD) PPE. INTERVENTIONS HCWs donned PPE according to standard protocols. 
      Fluorescent liquid and MS2 bacteriophage were applied to HCWs. HCWs then doffed 
      their PPE. After doffing, HCWs were scanned for fluorescence and swabbed for MS2. 
      MS2 detection was performed using reverse transcriptase PCR. The donning and 
      doffing processes were videotaped, and protocol deviations were recorded. RESULTS 
      Overall, 27% of EVD PPE HCWs and 50% of CP PPE HCWs made >/=1 protocol deviation 
      while donning, and 100% of EVD PPE HCWs and 67% of CP PPE HCWs made >/=1 protocol 
      deviation while doffing (P=.02). The median number of doffing protocol deviations 
      among EVD PPE HCWs was 4, versus 1 among CP PPE HCWs. Also, 15 EVD PPE protocol 
      deviations were committed by doffing assistants and/or trained observers. 
      Fluorescence was detected on 8 EVD PPE HCWs (44%) and 5 CP PPE HCWs (28%), most 
      commonly on hands. MS2 was recovered from 2 EVD PPE HCWs (11%) and 3 CP PPE HCWs 
      (17%). CONCLUSIONS Protocol deviations were common during both EVD and CP PPE 
      doffing, and some deviations during EVD PPE doffing were committed by the HCW 
      doffing assistant and/or the trained observer. Self-contamination was common. PPE 
      donning/doffing are complex and deserve additional study. Infect Control Hosp 
      Epidemiol 2017;38:1077-1083.

AB  - We conducted a case-control study in Freetown, Sierra Leone, to investigate 
      ocular signs in Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivors. A total of 82 EVD survivors 
      with ocular symptoms and 105 controls from asymptomatic civilian and military 
      personnel and symptomatic eye clinic attendees underwent ophthalmic examination, 
      including widefield retinal imaging. Snellen visual acuity was <6/7.5 in 75.6% 
      (97.5% CI 63%-85.7%) of EVD survivors and 75.5% (97.5% CI 59.1%-87.9%) of 
      controls. Unilateral white cataracts were present in 7.4% (97.5% CI 2.4%-16.7%) 
      of EVD survivors and no controls. Aqueous humor from 2 EVD survivors with 
      cataract but no anterior chamber inflammation were PCR-negative for Zaire Ebola 
      virus, permitting cataract surgery. A novel retinal lesion following the anatomic 
      distribution of the optic nerve axons occurred in 14.6% (97.5% CI 7.1%-25.6%) of 
      EVD survivors and no controls, suggesting neuronal transmission as a route of 
      ocular entry.

TI  - Mortality among PCR negative admitted Ebola suspects during the 2014/15 outbreak 
      in Conakry, Guinea: A retrospective cohort study.

AB  - Non-cases are suspect Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) cases testing negative by EVD 
      RT-PCR after admission to an Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC). Admitting non-cases to 
      an ETC prompts concerns on case- and workload in the ETC, risk for nosocomial EVD 
      infection, and delays in diagnosis and disease-specific treatment. We 
      retrospectively analysed characteristics, outcomes and determinants of death of 
      EVD cases and non-cases admitted to the Conakry ETC in Guinea between 03/2014 and 
      09/2015. Of the 2362 admitted suspects who underwent full confirmatory PCR 
      testing, 1540 (65.2%) were non-cases; among them 727 needed repeated confirmatory 
      PCR testing resulting in 2.5 days (average) in the ETC isolation ward. Twenty-one 
      patients tested positive on the repeat test, most in a period of flawed sampling 
      for the initial test and none after introduction of PCR confirmation with 
      geneXpert. No readmissions following nosocomial EVD infection were recorded. No 
      combination of symptoms yielded acceptable sensitivity and specificity to allow 
      differentiating confirmed from non-cases. Symptoms as ocular bleeding/redness 
      have high specificity, but limited usefulness as not common. Admission delay and 
      age distribution were not different for both groups. In total, 98 (20.6%) of 475 
      deaths in the ETC were non-cases. Most died within 24 hours after admission. 
      Living in Conakry (aOR 1.78 (1.08-2.96)) was the strongest risk factor for death. 
      Weeks with higher admission load had lower case fatality among non-cases, 
      probably because more acute (and treatable) illnesses of contacts of known cases 
      were admitted. These findings show high numbers of potentially critically ill 
      non-cases need to be considered when setting up triage and referral of EVD 
      suspect cases. Symptoms and risk factors alone do not allow differentiating the 
      non-cases. Integration of highly-sensitive EVD diagnostic methods with short 
      turnaround time in the triage of peripheral hospitals and dropping the systematic 
      2nd PCR for symptomatic early presenters could limit delays in access to adapted 
      care of cases and seriously ill non-cases. Whether feasible without compromising 
      outbreak control, and under which conditions, should be further assessed.

TI  - Deep Sequencing of RNA from Blood and Oral Swab Samples Reveals the Presence of 
      Nucleic Acid from a Number of Pathogens in Patients with Acute Ebola Virus 
      Disease and Is Consistent with Bacterial Translocation across the Gut.
LID - 10.1128/mSphereDirect.00325-17 [doi]
LID - e00325-17
AB  - In this study, samples from the 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus outbreak from 
      patients in Guinea with Ebola virus disease (EVD) were analyzed to discover and 
      classify what other pathogens were present. Throat swabs were taken from deceased 
      EVD patients, and peripheral blood samples were analyzed that had been taken from 
      patients when they presented at the treatment center with acute illness. 
      High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and bioinformatics were used to identify 
      the potential microorganisms. This approach confirmed Ebola virus (EBOV) in all 
      samples from patients diagnosed as acute positive for the virus by quantitative 
      reverse transcription-PCR in deployed field laboratories. Nucleic acid mapping to 
      Plasmodium was also used on the patient samples, confirming results obtained with 
      an antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (RDT) conducted in the field laboratories. 
      The data suggested that a high Plasmodium load, as determined by sequence read 
      depth, was associated with mortality and influenced the host response, whereas a 
      lower parasite load did not appear to affect outcome. The identifications of 
      selected bacteria from throat swabs via RNA-seq were confirmed by culture. The 
      data indicated that the potential pathogens identified in the blood samples were 
      associated with translocation from the gut, suggesting the presence of 
      bacteremia, which transcriptome data suggested may induce or aggravate the 
      acute-phase response observed during EVD. Transcripts mapping to different 
      viruses were also identified, including those indicative of lytic infections. The 
      development of high-resolution analysis of samples from patients with EVD will 
      help inform care pathways and the most appropriate general antimicrobial therapy 
      to be used in a resource-poor setting. IMPORTANCE Our results highlight the 
      identification of an array of pathogens in the blood of patients with Ebola virus 
      disease (EVD). This has not been done before, and the data have important 
      implications for the treatment of patients with EVD, particularly considering 
      antibiotic stewardship. We show that EVD patients who were also infected with 
      Plasmodium, particularly at higher loads, had more adverse outcomes than patients 
      with lower levels of Plasmodium. However, the presence of Plasmodium did not 
      influence the innate immune response, and it is likely that the presence of EBOV 
      dominated this response. Several viruses other than EBOV were identified, and 
      bacteria associated with sepsis were also identified. These findings were 
      indicative of bacterial translocation across the gut during the acute phase of 
      EVD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Global travel is an efficient route of transmission for highly 
      infectious pathogens and increases the chances of such pathogens moving from high 
      disease-endemic areas to new regions. We describe the rapid and safe 
      identification of the first imported case of Ebola virus disease in a traveler to 
      Lagos, Nigeria, using conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain 
      reaction (RT-PCR) in a biosafety level (BSL)-2 facility. CASE PRESENTATION: On 20 
      July 2014, a traveler arrived from Liberia at Lagos International Airport and was 
      admitted to a private hospital in Lagos, with clinical suspicion of Ebola virus 
      disease. METHODOLOGY AND OUTCOME: Blood and urine specimens were collected, 
      transported to the Virology Unit Laboratory at the College of Medicine, 
      University of Lagos, and processed under stringent biosafety conditions for viral 
      RNA extraction. RT-PCR was set-up to query the Ebola, Lassa and Dengue fever 
      viruses. Amplicons for pan-filoviruses were detected as 300 bp bands on a 1.5% 
      agarose gel image; there were no detectable bands for Lassa and Dengue viral RNA. 
      Nucleotide BLAST and phylogenetic analysis of sequence data of the RNA-dependent 
      RNA polymerase (L) gene confirmed the sequence to be Zaire ebolavirus 
      (EBOV/Hsap/NGA/2014/LIB-NIG 01072014; Genbank: KM251803.1). CONCLUSION: Our BSL-2 
      facility in Lagos, Nigeria, was able to safely detect Ebola virus disease using 
      molecular techniques, supporting the reliability of molecular detection of highly 
      infectious viral pathogens under stringent safety guidelines in BSL-2 
      laboratories. This is a significant lesson for the many under-facilitated 
      laboratories in resource-limited settings, as is predominantly found in 
      sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Laboratory-enhanced surveillance is critical for rapidly detecting 
      the potential re-emergence of Ebola virus disease. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) 
      for Ebola antigens could expand diagnostic capacity for Ebola virus disease. 
      OBJECTIVES: The Guinean National Coordination for Ebola Response conducted a 
      pilot implementation to determine the feasibility of broad screening of patients 
      and corpses with the OraQuick((R)) Ebola RDT. METHODS: The implementation team 
      developed protocols and trained healthcare workers to screen patients and corpses 
      in Forecariah prefecture, Guinea, from 15 October to 30 November 2015. Data 
      collected included number of consultations, number of fevers reported or 
      measured, number of tests performed for patients or corpses and results of 
      confirmatory RT-PCR testing. Data on malaria RDT results were collected for 
      comparison. Feedback from Ebola RDT users was collected informally during 
      supervision visits and forums. RESULTS: There were 3738 consultations at the 15 
      selected healthcare facilities; 74.6% of consultations were for febrile illness. 
      Among 2787 eligible febrile patients, 2633 were tested for malaria and 1628 
      OraQuick((R)) Ebola RDTs were performed. A total of 322 OraQuick((R)) Ebola RDTs were 
      conducted on corpses. All Ebola tests on eligible patients were negative. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Access to Ebola testing was expanded by the implementation of RDTs 
      in an emergency situation. Feedback from Ebola RDT users and lessons learned will 
      contribute to improving quality for RDT expansion.

AB  - Oligonucleotides are key elements of nucleic acid therapeutics such as small 
      interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Influenza and Ebolaviruses are zoonotic RNA viruses 
      mutating very rapidly, and their sequence changes must be characterized 
      intensively to design therapeutic oligonucleotides with long utility. Focusing on 
      a total of 182 experimentally validated siRNAs for influenza A, B and 
      Ebolaviruses compiled by the siRNA database, we conducted time-series analyses of 
      occurrences of siRNA targets in these viral genomes. Reflecting their high 
      mutation rates, occurrences of target oligonucleotides evidently fluctuate in 
      viral populations and often disappear. Time-series analysis of the one-base 
      changed sequences derived from each original target identified the 
      oligonucleotide that shows a compensatory increase and will potentially become 
      the 'awaiting-type oligonucleotide'; the combined use of this oligonucleotide 
      with the original can provide therapeutics with long utility. This strategy is 
      also useful for assigning diagnostic reverse transcription-PCR primers with long 
      utility.

AB  - The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa required the rapid testing of clinical 
      material for the presence of potentially high titre Ebola virus (EBOV). Safe, 
      fast and effective methods for the inactivation of such clinical samples are 
      required so that rapid diagnostic tests including downstream analysis by RT-qPCR 
      or nucleotide sequencing can be carried out. One of the most commonly used 
      guanidinium - based denaturing agents, AVL (Qiagen) has been shown to fully 
      inactivate EBOV once ethanol is added, however this is not compatible with the 
      use of automated nucleic acid extraction systems. Additional inactivation agents 
      need to be identified that can be used in automated systems. A candidate 
      inactivation agent is Triton X-100, a non-denaturing detergent that is frequently 
      used in clinical nucleic acid extraction procedures and has previously been used 
      for inactivation of EBOV. In this study the effect of 0.1% and 1.0% Triton X-100 
      (final concentration 0.08% and 0.8% respectively) alone and in combination with 
      AVL on the viability of EBOV (10(6) TCID(50)/ml) spiked into commercially 
      available pooled negative human serum was tested. The presence of viable EBOV in 
      the treated samples was assessed by carrying out three serial passages of the 
      samples in Vero E6 cells (37 degrees C, 5% CO(2), 1 week for each passage). At the end of 
      each passage the cells were observed for evidence of cytopathic effect and 
      samples were taken for rRT-PCR analysis for the presence of EBOV RNA. Before cell 
      culture cytotoxic components of AVL and Triton X-100 were removed from the 
      samples using size exclusion spin column technology or a hydrophobic adsorbent 
      resin. The results of this study showed that EBOV spiked into human serum was not 
      fully inactivated when treated with either 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 mins or 
      1.0% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 20 mins (final concentrations 0.08% and 0.8% Triton 
      X-100 respectively). AVL alone also did not consistently provide complete 
      inactivation. Samples treated with both AVL and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 or 20 
      mins were shown to be completely inactivated. This treatment is compatible with 
      downstream analysis by RT-qPCR and next generation sequencing.

AB  - Modern ebolavirus diagnostics rely primarily on quantitative reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), a sensitive method to detect 
      viral genetic material in the acute phase of the disease. However, qRT-PCR does 
      not confirm presence of infectious virus, presenting limitations in patient and 
      outbreak management. Attempts to isolate infectious virus rely on in vivo or 
      basic cell culture approaches, which prohibit rapid results and screening. In 
      this study, we present a novel reporter cell line capable of detecting live 
      ebolaviruses. These cells permit sensitive, large-scale screening and titration 
      of infectious virus in experimental and clinical samples, independent of 
      ebolavirus species and variant.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Efficient interruption of Ebola virus disease (EVD) transmission 
      chains critically depends on reliable and fast laboratory diagnosis. We evaluated 
      the performance of the EBOLA Virus Antigen Detection K-SeT (EBOLA Ag K-SeT), a 
      new rapid diagnostic antigen test in field settings. METHODS: The study was 
      conducted in a field laboratory located in Freetown (Sierra Leone) by the Italian 
      National Institute for Infectious Diseases 'L. Spallanzani' and the EMERGENCY 
      Onlus NGO. The EBOLA Ag K-SeT was tested on 210 residual plasma samples (EVD 
      prevalence 50%) from patients hospitalized at the EMERGENCY Ebola treatment 
      center in Goderich (Freetown), comparing the results with quantitative real-time 
      PCR. RESULTS: Overall, the sensitivity of EBOLA Ag K-SeT was 88.6% (95% 
      confidence interval (CI), 82.5-94.7), and the corresponding specificity was 98.1% 
      (95% CI, 95.5-100.7). The positive and negative predictive values were 97.9% (95% 
      CI, 95.0-100.8) and 89.6% (95% CI, 84-95.2), respectively. The sensitivity 
      strongly increased up to 98.7% (95% CI, 96.1-101.2) for those samples with high 
      virus load (>/=6.2 log RNA copies/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that EBOLA 
      Ag K-SeT could represent a new effective diagnostic tool for EVD, meeting a need 
      for resource-poor settings and rapid diagnosis for individuals with suspected 
      EVD.

AB  - One of the main challenges in the diagnosis of infectious diseases is the need 
      for rapid and accurate detection of the causative pathogen in any setting. Rapid 
      diagnosis is key to avoiding the spread of the disease, to allow proper clinical 
      decisions to be made in terms of patient treatment, and to mitigate the rise of 
      drug-resistant pathogens. In the last decade, significant interest has been 
      devoted to the development of point-of-care reverse transcription polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) platforms for the detection of RNA-based viral pathogens. We 
      present the development of a microfluidic, real-time, fluorescence-based, 
      continuous-flow reverse transcription PCR system. The system incorporates a 
      disposable microfluidic chip designed to be produced industrially with 
      cost-effective roll-to-roll embossing methods. The chip has a long microfluidic 
      channel that directs the PCR solution through areas heated to different 
      temperatures. The solution first travels through a reverse transcription zone 
      where RNA is converted to complementary DNA, which is later amplified and 
      detected in real time as it travels through the thermal cycling area. As a proof 
      of concept, the system was tested for Ebola virus detection. Two different master 
      mixes were tested, and the limit of detection of the system was determined, as 
      was the maximum speed at which amplification occurred. Our results and the 
      versatility of our system suggest its promise for the detection of other 
      RNA-based viruses such as Zika virus or chikungunya virus, which constitute 
      global health threats worldwide. Graphical abstract Photograph of the RT-PCR

AB  - Ebola virus is a filovirus that can cause fatal hemorrhagic fever (HF) and five 
      distinct species exist that vary in terms of geographical distribution and 
      virulence. Once the more virulent forms enter the human population, transmission 
      occurs primarily through direct contact with infected body fluids and may result 
      in significant outbreaks. The devastating has been the recent West African 
      outbreak. Clinically, signs and symptoms are similar to those of the other VHFs 
      [4]. The incubation period is 2-21days, followed by fever, headache, myalgia, 
      diarrhoea, vomiting and dehydration; thereafter, there may be recovery or 
      deterioration with collapse, neurological manifestations and bleeding, that can 
      lead to a fatal outcome. Elevated hepatic transaminases is common and severe 
      hepatitis is more common in fatal cases and frequently there is associated fluid 
      depletion. Real time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) techniques on blood 
      specimens are the gold standard for diagnosis [6]. Management is discussed and is 
      essentially supportive with strict attention to infection control and prevention. 
      None of the pharmacological interventions have shown conclusive benefit and 
      future management of epidemics should centre around prevention and containment, 
      specifically isolation, hygiene, and vaccination.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2013-2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak showed a lack of 
      diagnostic point-of-care methods. Currently, EBOV diagnosis relies on 
      quantitative reverse-transcription-PCR (RT- qPCR), highly specific and sensitive, 
      but requiring skilled personnel and well-equipped laboratories. In field 
      settings, these factors and others, such as samples' time of collection and 
      transportation, determine a prolonged turnaround-time to final results. In 
      outbreak scenarios, a rapid and transportable method could eliminate issues of 
      cohorting suspected and actual EVD patients for lack of diagnostic certainty. The 
      aim of this study was the field evaluation of the new fast, easy-to-use and 
      reliable RT-qPCR assay and platform for EBOV detection, developed in the 
      framework of the EbolaMoDRAD project by CLONIT S.r.l. and STMicroelectronics 
      S.r.l. STUDY DESIGN: We evaluated its performance during the outbreak and in 
      further studies in the EVD laboratory at the Princess Christian Maternity 
      Hospital (PCMH) in Freetown (Sierra Leone) run by Emergency NGO and the Italian 
      National Institute for Infectious Diseases (INMI). The assay was tested on 
      residual aliquots of clinical specimens from EBOV-positive or -negative patients 
      (n=116, EVD prevalence 37%). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Overall, the test was very 
      easy-to-use and the instrument was robust and reliable in field-settings. The 
      sensitivity of the assay was 100% and the specificity was 98.63% (95%CI: 
      96.34-100.92%). The positive and negative predictive values were 97.73 
      (95%CI:94.77-100.68%) and 100%, respectively. The high sensitivity and 
      specificity of this new assay indicate that it is promising for laboratory 
      diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) at the 
      point of care have the potential to increase access and acceptability of EVD 
      testing and the speed of patient isolation and secure burials for suspect cases. 
      A pilot program for EVD RDTs in high risk areas of Guinea was introduced in 
      October 2015. This paper presents concordance data between EVD RDTs and PCR 
      testing in the field as well as an assessment of the acceptability, feasibility, 
      and quality assurance of the RDT program. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Concordance data 
      were compiled from laboratory surveillance databases. The operational measures of 
      the laboratory-based EVD RDT program were evaluated at all 34 sentinel sites in 
      Guinea through: (1) a technical questionnaire filled by the lab technicians who 
      performed the RDTs, (2) a checklist filled by the evaluator during the site 
      visits, and (3) direct observation of the lab technicians performing the quality 
      control test. Acceptability of the EVD RDT was good for technicians, patients, 
      and families although many technicians (69.8%) expressed concern for their safety 
      while performing the test. The feasibility of the program was good based on 
      average technician knowledge scores (6.6 out of 8) but basic infrastructure, 
      equipment, and supplies were lacking. There was much room for improvement in 
      quality assurance of the program. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of new 
      diagnostics in weak laboratory systems requires general training in quality 
      assurance, biosafety and communication with patients in addition to specific 
      training for the new test. Corresponding capacity building in terms of basic 
      equipment and a long-term commitment to transfer supervision and quality 
      improvement to national public health staff are necessary for successful 
      implementation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The unprecedented size of the 2014 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak 
      in West Africa has allowed for a more extensive characterization of the clinical 
      presentation and management of this disease. In this study, we report the trends 
      in morbidity, mortality, and determinants of patient survival as EVD spread into 
      Bong County, Liberia. METHODS: An analysis of suspected, probable, or confirmed 
      cases of EVD (n = 607) reported to the Liberian Ministry of Health and Social 
      Welfare (MOHSW) between March 23(rd) and December 31(st) 2014 was conducted. The 
      likelihood of infection given exposure factors was determined using logistic 
      regression in individuals with a definitive diagnosis by RT-PCR (n = 321). The 
      risk of short-term mortality (30 days) given demographic factors, clinical 
      symptoms, and highest level of treatment received was assessed with Cox 
      regression and survival analyses (n = 391). RESULTS: The overall mortality rate 
      was 53.5 % (95 % CI: 49 %, 58 %) and decreased as access to medical treatment 
      increased. Those who reported contact with another EVD case were more likely to 
      be infected (OR: 5.7), as were those who attended a funeral (OR: 3.9). Mortality 
      increased with age (P < 0.001) and was higher in males compared to females (P 
      =0.006). Fever (HR: 6.63), vomiting (HR: 1.93), diarrhea (HR: 1.99), and 
      unexplained bleeding (HR: 2.17) were associated with increased mortality. After 
      adjusting for age, hospitalized patients had a 74 % reduction in the risk of 
      short term mortality (P < 0.001 AHR: 0.26; 95 % CI AHR: 0.18, 0.37), compared to 
      those not given medical intervention. CONCLUSION: Even treatment with only basic 
      supportive care such as intravenous rehydration therapy was able to significantly 
      improve patient survival in suspected, probable, or confirmed EVD cases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited data exist describing supportive care management, laboratory 
      abnormalities and outcomes in patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West 
      Africa. We report data which constitute the first description of the provision of 
      enhanced EVD case management protocols in a West African setting. METHODS: 
      Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected by retrospective review 
      of clinical and laboratory records of patients with confirmed EVD admitted 
      between 5 November 2014 and 30 June 2015. RESULTS: A total of 44 EVD patients 
      were admitted (median age 37 years (range 17-63), 32/44 healthcare workers), and 
      excluding those evacuated, the case fatality rate was 49% (95% CI 33%-65%). No 
      pregnant women were admitted. At admission 9/44 had stage 1 disease (fever and 
      constitutional symptoms only), 12/44 had stage 2 disease (presence of diarrhoea 
      and/or vomiting) and 23/44 had stage 3 disease (presence of diarrhoea and/or 
      vomiting with organ failure), with case fatality rates of 11% (95% CI 1%-58%), 
      27% (95% CI 6%-61%), and 70% (95% CI 47%-87%) respectively (p = 0.009). 
      Haemorrhage occurred in 17/41 (41%) patients. The majority (21/40) of patients 
      had hypokalaemia with hyperkalaemia occurring in 12/40 patients. Acute kidney 
      injury (AKI) occurred in 20/40 patients, with 14/20 (70%, 95% CI 46%-88%) dying, 
      compared to 5/20 (25%, 95% CI 9%-49%) dying who did not have AKI (p = 0.01). 
      Ebola virus (EBOV) PCR cycle threshold value at baseline was mean 20.3 (SD 4.3) 
      in fatal cases and 24.8 (SD 5.5) in survivors (p = 0.007). Mean national early 
      warning score (NEWS) at admission was 5.5 (SD 4.4) in fatal cases and 3.0 (SD 
      1.9) in survivors (p = 0.02). Central venous catheters were placed in 37/41 
      patients and intravenous fluid administered to 40/41 patients (median duration of 
      5 days). Faecal management systems were inserted in 21/41 patients, urinary 
      catheters placed in 27/41 and blood component therapy administered to 20/41 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: EVD is commonly associated life-threatening electrolyte 
      imbalance and organ dysfunction. We believe that the enhanced levels of 
      protocolized care, scale and range of medical interventions we report, offer a 
      blueprint for the future management of EVD in resource-limited settings.

AB  - Engineered liver systems come in a variety of platform models, from 2-dimensional 
      cocultures of primary human hepatocytes and stem cell-derived progeny, to 
      3-dimensional organoids and humanized mice. Because of the species-specificity of 
      many human hepatropic pathogens, these engineered systems have been essential 
      tools for biologic discovery and therapeutic agent development in the context of 
      liver-dependent infectious diseases. Although improvement of existing models is 
      always beneficial, and the addition of a robust immune component is a particular 
      need, at present, considerable progress has been made using this combination of 
      research platforms. We highlight advances in the study of hepatitis B and C 
      viruses and malaria-causing Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax parasites, 
      and underscore the importance of pairing the most appropriate model system and 
      readout modality with the particular experimental question at hand, without 
      always requiring a platform that recapitulates human physiology in its entirety.

AB  - Filoviruses are important etiological agents of emergent diseases with high 
      mortality rates. Traditionally, filovirus fever diseases have primarily been a 
      burden of African countries; however, global interconnectedness has increased the 
      probability of the worldwide spread of filoviruses. Therefore, national 
      healthcare organizations need tools for managing filovirus risk, including 
      diagnostic kits based on real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR), as this 
      is the most suitable method for diagnosing filovirus fever diseases. Here we 
      describe a real-time RT-qPCR assay for filovirus detection. This assay is a 
      further development of our previously reported EBOV (Zaire)-Fl kit. Two sets 
      (FiloA-Fl and FiloB-Fl) of real-time RT-qPCR assays for the detection of 
      filoviruses were developed and evaluated using armored RNA phage particles (ARs) 
      as positive controls. The limit of detection of the assay was 5x10(2) copies/ml 
      of the AR-positive control for the FiloA-Fl set and 5x10(3) copies/ml of the 
      AR-positive control for the FiloB-Fl set. Our assay provides a rapid and 
      sensitive tool for detecting filoviruses. The high specificity and sensitivity of 
      the assay make it useful for clinical and epidemiologic investigations in the 
      field of filovirus fever diseases and their etiological agents.

AB  - Chimeric reads can be generated by in vitro recombination during the preparation 
      of high-throughput sequencing libraries. Our attempt to detect biological 
      recombination between the genomes of dengue virus (DENV; +ssRNA genome) and its 
      mosquito host using the Illumina Nextera sequencing library preparation kit 
      revealed that most, if not all, detected host-virus chimeras were artificial. 
      Indeed, these chimeras were not more frequent than with control RNA from another 
      species (a pillbug), which was never in contact with DENV RNA prior to the 
      library preparation. The proportion of chimera types merely reflected those of 
      the three species among sequencing reads. Chimeras were frequently characterized 
      by the presence of 1-20 bp microhomology between recombining fragments. 
      Within-species chimeras mostly involved fragments in opposite orientations and 
      located less than 100 bp from each other in the parental genome. We found similar 
      features in published datasets using two other viruses: Ebola virus (EBOV; -ssRNA 
      genome) and a herpesvirus (dsDNA genome), both produced with the Illumina Nextera 
      protocol. These canonical features suggest that artificial chimeras are generated 
      by intra-molecular template switching of the DNA polymerase during the PCR step 
      of the Nextera protocol. Finally, a published Illumina dataset using the Flock 
      House virus (FHV; +ssRNA genome) generated with a protocol preventing artificial 
      recombination revealed the presence of 1-10 bp microhomology motifs in FHV-FHV 
      chimeras, but very few recombining fragments were in opposite orientations. Our 
      analysis uncovered sequence features characterizing recombination breakpoints in 
      short-read sequencing datasets, which can be helpful to evaluate the presence and 
      extent of artificial recombination.

AB  - Laboratory testing to support the care of patients with highly infectious 
      diseases may pose a risk for laboratory workers. However, data on the risk of 
      virus transmission during routine laboratory testing conducted using standard 
      personal protective equipment (PPE) are sparse. Our objective was to measure 
      laboratory contamination during routine analysis of patient specimens. Remnant 
      specimens were spiked with the nonpathogenic bacteriophage MS2 at 1.0 x 10(7) 
      PFU/ml, and contamination was assessed using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) 
      for MS2. Specimen containers were exteriorly coated with a fluorescent powder to 
      enable the visualization of gross contamination using UV light. Testing was 
      performed by two experienced laboratory technologists using standard laboratory 
      PPE and sample-to-answer instrumentation. Fluorescence was noted on the gloves, 
      bare hands, and laboratory coat cuffs of the laboratory technologist in 36/36 
      (100%), 13/36 (36%), and 4/36 (11%) tests performed, respectively. Fluorescence 
      was observed in the biosafety cabinet (BSC) in 8/36 (22%) tests, on test 
      cartridges/devices in 14/32 (44%) tests, and on testing accessory items in 29/32 
      (91%) tests. Fluorescence was not observed on or in laboratory instrumentation or 
      adjacent surfaces. In contrast to fluorescence detection, MS2 detection was 
      infrequent (3/286 instances [1%]) and occurred during test setup for the 
      FilmArray instrument and on FilmArray accessory equipment. The information from 
      this study may provide opportunities for the improvement of clinical laboratory 
      safety practices so as to reduce the risk of pathogen transmission to laboratory 
      workers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivors are at risk for uveitis during 
      convalescence. Vision loss has been observed following uveitis due to cataracts. 
      Since Ebola virus (EBOV) may persist in the ocular fluid of EVD survivors for an 
      unknown duration, there are questions about the safety and feasibility of vision 
      restorative cataract surgery in EVD survivors. METHODS: We conducted a 
      cross-sectional study of EVD survivors anticipating cataract surgery and patients 
      with active uveitis to evaluate EBOV RNA persistence in ocular fluid, as well as 
      vision outcomes post cataract surgery. Patients with aqueous humor that tested 
      negative for EBOV RNA were eligible to proceed with manual small incision 
      cataract surgery (MSICS). FINDINGS: We screened 137 EVD survivors from June 2016 
      - August 2017 for enrolment. We enrolled 50 EVD survivors; 46 with visually 
      significant cataract, 1 with a subluxated lens, 2 with active uveitis and 1 with 
      a blind painful eye due to uveitis. The median age was 24.0years (IQR 17-35) and 
      35 patients (70%) were female. The median logMAR visual acuity (VA) was 3.0 
      (Snellen VA Hand motions; Interquartile Range, IQR: 1.2-3.0, Snellen VA 20/320 - 
      Hand motions). All patients tested negative for EBOV RNA by RT-PCR in aqueous 
      humor/vitreous fluid and conjunctiva at a median of 19months (IQR 18-20) from EVD 
      diagnosis in Phase 1 of ocular fluid sampling and 34months (IQR 32-36) from EVD 
      diagnosis in Phase 2 of ocular fluid sampling. Thirty-four patients underwent 
      MSICS, with a preoperative median VA improvement from hand motions to 20/30 at 
      three-month postoperative follow-up (P<0.001). INTERPRETATION: EBOV persistence 
      by RT-PCR was not identified in ocular fluid or conjunctivae of fifty EVD 
      survivors with ocular disease. Cataract surgery can be performed safely with 
      vision restorative outcomes in patients who test negative for EBOV RNA in ocular 
      fluid specimens. These findings impact the thousands of West African EVD 
      survivors at-risk for ocular complications who may also require eye surgery 
      during EVD convalescence.

AB  - Among 149 men who survived Ebola virus disease (EVD) and donated semen 260-1016 
      days after EVD onset, Ebola virus (EBOV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) was detected in 
      13 (9%). Of 137 men who donated semen 2 years after EVD onset, 11 (8%) had an 
      EBOV RNA-positive specimen. The mechanism underlying the persistence of EBOV RNA 
      in semen is unclear, and it is unclear whether the detection of viral RNA 
      represents the presence of infectious virus.

TI  - Dengue virus not detected in human semen.
LID - 10.1093/jtm/tay023 [doi]
AB  - Zika and Ebola viruses can persist in semen and pose a risk for sexual 
      transmission. To determine if dengue virus, another flavivirus, is similarly 
      detectable in semen, we performed dengue PCR on semen in five patients with acute 
      dengue virus infection. All five tested negative, suggesting that dengue does not 
      pose a risk for sexual transmission.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2014/2015 Ebolavirus outbreak resulted in more than 28,000 cases 
      and 11,323 reported deaths, as of March 2016. Domestic transmission of the Guinea 
      strain associated with the outbreak occurred mainly in six African countries, and 
      international transmission was reported in four countries. Outbreak management 
      was limited by the inability to rapidly diagnose infected cases. A further 
      fifteen countries in Africa are predicted to be at risk of Ebolavirus outbreaks 
      in the future as a consequence of climate change and urbanization. Early 
      detection of cases and reduction of transmission rates is critical to prevent and 
      manage future severe outbreaks. We designed a rapid assay for detection of 
      Ebolavirus using recombinase polymerase amplification, a rapid isothermal 
      amplification technology that can be combined with portable lateral flow 
      detection technology. The developed rapid assay operates in 30 min and was 
      comparable with real-time TaqMan PCR. METHODS: Designed, screened, selected and 
      optimized oligonucleotides using the NP coding region from Ebola Zaire virus 
      (Guinea strain). We determined the analytical sensitivity of our Ebola rapid 
      molecular test by testing selected primers and probe with tenfold serial 
      dilutions (1.34 x 10(10-) 1.34 x 10(1) copies/muL) of cloned NP gene from Mayinga 
      strain of Zaire ebolavirus in pCAGGS vector, and serially diluted cultured 
      Ebolavirus as established by real-time TaqMan PCR that was performed using 
      ABI7500 in Fast Mode. We tested extracted and reverse transcribed RNA from 
      cultured Zaire ebolavirus strains - Mayinga, Gueckedou C05, Gueckedou C07, 
      Makona, Kissidougou and Kiwit. We determined the analytical specificity of our 
      assay with related viruses: Marburg, Ebola Reston and Ebola Sudan. We further 
      tested for Dengue virus 1-4, Plasmodium falciparum and West Nile Virus (Kunjin 
      strain). RESULTS: The assay had a detection limit of 134 copies per muL of plasmid 
      containing the NP gene of Ebolavirus Mayinga, and cultured Ebolavirus and was 
      highly specific for the Zaire ebolavirus species, including the Guinea strain 
      responsible for the 2014/2015 outbreak. The assay did not detect related viruses 
      like Marburg, Reston, or Sudan viruses, and other pathogens likely to be isolated 
      from clinical samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our assay could be suitable for 
      implementation in district and primary health laboratories, as only a heating 
      block and centrifuge is required for operation. The technique could provide a 
      pathway for rapid screening of patients and animals for improved management of 
      outbreaks.

TI  - A Rapid Screen for Host-Encoded miRNAs with Inhibitory Effects against Ebola 
      Virus Using a Transcription- and Replication-Competent Virus-Like Particle 
      System.
LID - 10.3390/ijms19051488 [doi]
LID - 1488
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may become efficient antiviral agents against the Ebola virus 
      (EBOV) targeting viral genomic RNAs or transcripts. We previously conducted a 
      genome-wide search for differentially expressed miRNAs during viral replication 
      and transcription. In this study, we established a rapid screen for miRNAs with 
      inhibitory effects against EBOV using a tetracistronic transcription- and 
      replication-competent virus-like particle (trVLP) system. This system uses a 
      minigenome comprising an EBOV leader region, luciferase reporter, VP40, GP, VP24, 
      EBOV trailer region, and three noncoding regions from the EBOV genome and can be 
      used to model the life cycle of EBOV under biosafety level (BSL) 2 conditions. 
      Informatic analysis was performed to select up-regulated miRNAs targeting the 
      coding regions of the minigenome with the highest binding energy to perform 
      inhibitory effect screening. Among these miRNAs, miR-150-3p had the most 
      significant inhibitory effect. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
      (RT-PCR), Western blot, and double fluorescence reporter experiments demonstrated 
      that miR-150-3p inhibited the reproduction of trVLPs via the regulation of GP and 
      VP40 expression by directly targeting the coding regions of GP and VP40. This 
      novel, rapid, and convenient screening method will efficiently facilitate the 
      exploration of miRNAs against EBOV under BSL-2 conditions.

TI  - Suspected Exposure to Filoviruses Among People Contacting Wildlife in 
      Southwestern Uganda.
PG  - S277-S286
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiy251 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human and filovirus host interactions remain poorly understood in 
      areas where Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreaks are likely to occur. In the Bwindi 
      region of Uganda, a hot spot of mammalian biodiversity in Africa, human 
      livelihoods are intimately connected with wildlife, creating potential for 
      exposure to filoviruses. METHODS: We tested samples from 331 febrile patients 
      presenting to healthcare facilities near Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, Uganda, by 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and Western blot, using recombinant 
      glycoprotein antigens for Ebola virus (EBOV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Bundibugyo 
      virus (BDBV), and Marburg virus. Behavioral data on contact with wildlife were 
      collected to examine risk factors for filovirus seropositivity. RESULTS: All 
      patients were negative for active filovirus infection, by PCR analysis. However, 
      patients were seroreactive to SUDV (4.7%), EBOV (5.3%), and BDBV (8.9%), 
      indicating previous exposure. Touching duikers was the most significant risk 
      factor associated with EBOV seropositivity, while hunting primates and touching 
      and/or eating cane rats were significant risk factors for SUDV seropositivity. 
      CONCLUSIONS: People in southwestern Uganda have suspected previous exposure to 
      filoviruses, particularly those with a history of wildlife contact. Circulation 
      of filoviruses in wild animals and subsequent spillover into humans could be more 
      common than previously reported.

      over the world. The significant advantages of Luminex xMAP technology are 
      high-throughput, high parallel and automation. This study aimed to establish a 
      liquid bead array based on Luminex xMAP technology that was able to 
      simultaneously detect multiple insect-borne pathogens. METHODS: Specific probes 
      and primers to detect the nucleic acid of 10 insect-borne pathogens were 
      designed. Probes were coupled with fluorescent carboxylated microspheres. The 
      parameters of the system were optimized, including ratio of forward/reverse 
      primers (1:2), hybridization temperature (50  degrees C) and duration (30 min) and 
      quantity of PCR product (2 mul). The sensitivity and specificity of the system 
      were also evaluated. Moreover mixed nucleic acid of 10 insect-borne pathogens, 
      including Bluetongue virus, Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus of deer, Coxiella 
      burnetii, African swine fever virus, West Nile fever virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, 
      vesicular stomatitis virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Ebola virus and 
      Schmalenberg's disease virus, and 3000 clinical samples were tested for 
      practicability. RESULTS: The optimized detection system showed high sensitivity, 
      specificity and reproducibility. Each probe showed specific fluorescence signal 
      intensity without any cross-hybridization for the other insect-borne pathogens 
      tested, which included dengue virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Japanese 
      encephalitis virus, Xinjiang hemorrhagic fever virus, spotted fever group 
      rickettsiae, ehrlichiae and chikungunya virus. The limit of detection was 10 
      copies of target gene. Insect-borne pathogens were successfully detected among 
      the 3000 clinical samples, and the results were consistent with those obtained 
      using gold-standard assays or commercial nucleic acid detection kits. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This optimized liquid array detection system was high-throughput and 
      highly specific and sensitive in screening of the insect-borne pathogens. It was 
      promising in detection of these pathogens for molecular epidemiological studies.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the serological characteristics of Ebola virus 
      (EBOV) infection during the late phase of the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone. In 
      total, 877 blood samples from 694 suspected Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases 
      assessed from March to December 2015, were analyzed via real-time reverse 
      transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for viral RNA and enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Luminex to detect antibodies against EBOV. Viral 
      load and EBOV-specific IgM/IgG titers displayed a declining trend during March to 
      December 2015. Viral RNA load decreased rapidly at earlier stages after disease 
      onset, while EBOV-specific IgM and IgG still persisted in 58.1% (18/31) and 93.5% 
      (29/31) of the confirmed EVD patients and in 3.8% (25/663) and 17.8% (118/663) of 
      the RNA-negative suspected patients in the later phase, respectively. Dynamic 
      analysis of longitudinally collected samples from eight EVD patients revealed 
      typically reversed trends of declining viral load and increasing IgM and/or IgG 
      titers in response to the EBOV infection. The present results indicate that 
      certain populations of Sierra Leone developed immunity to an EBOV infection in 
      the late phase of the outbreak, providing novel insights into the risk assessment 
      of EBOV infections among human populations.

AB  - In January 2015, Public Health England and the United Kingdom (UK) Ministry of 
      Defence investigated cases of diarrhoea and fever in military personnel recently 
      returned to the UK after supporting the response to the Ebola epidemic in Sierra 
      Leone. Tests for Ebola virus infection were negative. PCR tests detected the ipaH 
      gene in 10/12 faecal specimens, and Shigella boydii serotype 20 was isolated from 
      7 patients. A case control study was undertaken and analysed using multivariable 
      logistic regression. Consumption of a coronation chicken lunch at the transit 
      camp in Sierra Leone (SL) 24-48 h prior to departure for the UK was significantly 
      associated with disease [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 28.15, 95 % CI: 1.87-422.65]. 
      In the context of heightened concern during the Ebola epidemic, this outbreak 
      highlights the importance of rapid and effective microbiological and 
      epidemiological investigations to identify the aetiological agent in patients 
      presenting with fever and diarrhoea.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Disruption of malaria control strategies during the West African 
      2014-2016 Ebola epidemic led to an increase in malaria-attributable mortality. 
      However, recent data on malaria infection in vulnerable groups, such as pregnant 
      women, are lacking in this post-Ebola scenario. This cross-sectional study aimed 
      to assess the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum infection and of molecular 
      markers of drug resistance among pregnant women attending antenatal care in 
      Monrovia, capital of Liberia. METHODS: From October 2016 to June 2017, all 
      pregnant women attending their first antenatal care visit at the Saint Joseph's 
      Catholic Hospital, Monrovia, were invited to participate in the study. In 
      addition to their routine antenatal care tests, capillary blood spotted onto 
      filter papers were collected from all consenting participants to determine 
      presence of P. falciparum by real-time quantitative PCR. Molecular markers of 
      anti-malarial drug resistance were assessed through Sanger sequencing and 
      quantitative PCR in specimens positive for P. falciparum analysis. RESULTS: Of 
      the 195 women participants, 24 (12.3%) were P. falciparum-positive by qPCR. 
      Infected women tended to be more commonly primigravidae and younger than 
      uninfected ones. Parasite densities were higher in primigravidae. Fever was more 
      frequently detected among the infected women. No statistically significant 
      association between P. falciparum infection and haemoglobin levels or 
      insecticide-treated net use was found. While high prevalence of genetic 
      polymorphisms associated with chloroquine and amodiaquine resistance were 
      detected, no molecular markers of artemisinin resistance were observed. 
      CONCLUSION: Plasmodium falciparum infections are expected to occur in at least 
      one in every eight women attending first ANC at private clinics in Monrovia and 
      outside the peak of the rainy season. Young primigravidae are at increased risk 
      of P. falciparum infection. Molecular analyses did not provide evidence of 
      resistance to artemisinins among the P. falciparum isolates tested. Further 
      epidemiological studies involving pregnant women are necessary to describe the 
      risk of malaria in this highly susceptible group outside Monrovia, as well as to 
      closely monitor the emergence of resistance to anti-malarials, as recommended by 
      the Liberian National Malaria Control Programme.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are presently the most promising 
      treatment against Ebola virus disease (EVD), and cocktail of two or more 
      antibodies likely confers protection through complementary mechanisms. Zaire 
      Ebolavirus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) and viral protein 40 (VP40) are targets for 
      designing neutralizing antibodies. Currently, the antiviral therapeutics of 
      mAb-cocktails are still limited solely to anti-GP antibodies，there is no Abs 
      cocktail against Zaire EBOV GP and VP40, which both have important interactions 
      with host cellular membrane. METHODS: We used hybridoma technology to produce 
      anti-Zaire EBOV GP mAb against GP receptor binding domain, and anti-Zaire EBOV 
      VP40 mAbs against the N-terminal domain, the C-terminal domain, respectively; 
      synthesized Zaire EBOV transcription and replication competent virus like 
      particles (trVLPs), which model even all aspects of the EBOV life cycles in order 
      to evaluate the anti-viral effect of mAbs. Then, we characterized the anti- Zaire 
      EBOV trVLPs effect of anti-GP and VP40 mAbs in vitro by real time-PCR, 
      immunofluorescence assay and western blot analysis. RESULTS: Our results 
      demonstrate that anti-GP or anti-VP40 mAbs effectively inhibit trVLPs 
      replication. The cocktails of anti-GP and anti-VP40 mAbs, or between anti-VP40 
      mAbs, had synergistic anti-trVLPs effect. Meanwhile, the detailed DNA and amino 
      acid sequences of the mAbs were checked. CONCLUSION: The study verifies 
      neutralizing efficacy of anti-GP or anti-VP40 mAb, report promising cocktail of 
      anti-GP and anti-VP40 mAb, or cocktail of two anti-VP40 mAbs. To our knowledge, 
      this is the first account to report the important anti-viral effect of cocktails 
      of anti-GP and anti-VP40 mAbs in vitro.

AB  - Rapid pathogen identification during an acute febrile illness is a critical first 
      step for providing appropriate clinical care and patient isolation. Primary 
      screening using sensitive and specific assays, such as real-time PCR and ELISAs, 
      can rapidly test for known circulating infectious diseases. If the initial 
      testing is negative, potentially due to a lack of developed diagnostic assays or 
      an incomplete understanding of the pathogens circulating within a geographic 
      region, additional testing would be required including highly multiplexed assays 
      and metagenomic next generation sequencing. To bridge the gap between rapid point 
      of care diagnostics and sequencing, we developed a highly multiplexed assay 
      designed to detect 164 different viruses, bacteria, and parasites using the 
      NanoString nCounter platform. Included in this assay were high consequence 
      pathogens such as Ebola virus, highly endemic organisms including several 
      Plasmodium species, and a large number of less prevalent pathogens to ensure a 
      broad coverage of potential human pathogens. Evaluation of this panel resulted in 
      positive detection of 113 (encompassing 98 different human pathogen types) of the 
      126 organisms available to us including the medically important Ebola virus, 
      Lassa virus, dengue virus serotypes 1-4, Chikungunya virus, yellow fever virus, 
      and Plasmodium falciparum. Overall, this assay could improve infectious disease 
      diagnostics and biosurveillance efforts as a quick, highly multiplexed, and easy 
      to use pathogen screening tool.

AB  - During the mid-transmission period of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in 
      Sierra Leone, a 19-year-old pregnant woman, who was a petty trader in a health 
      facility in Freetown, noticing no fetal movement for the past 3 days, reported to 
      a health facility. Medical history and laboratory testing showed no abnormalities 
      except that she was positive for sickle cell. She was not known to any 
      surveillance team of having any epidemiological link to EVD case. She was induced 
      with oral medications as well as IV infusion. EVD test showed that the fetus was 
      positive to EVD with a high threshold value of 21, while the woman was negative 
      for EVD with a threshold value of 42. The woman was positive to EVD IgG but 
      negative to EVD IgM by ELISA technique. This is a rare EVD case in the period of 
      medium transmission. We conclude that the woman may have come into contact with a 
      low dose of virus not enough to cause a full blown EVD and that her immune system 
      was able to stop the virus from further replication.

AB  - The reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction method (RT-PCR) has leading 
      position on diagnostic infections, caused by RNA-containing viruses. This method 
      presents severe requirements to carrying out of everybody stages of analysis 
      (extraction of nucleic acid, carry out reverse transcription, amplification of 
      DNA). It is necessary to account the possibility of false positive or false 
      negative results appearance. The use on RT-PCR only positive (PCS) and negative 
      (NCS) control samples is insufficient for the control of stages of RNA extraction 
      and reverse transcription. That is way there is necessity the construction of 
      inner control sample (ICS) to control of these stages. The main goal of present 
      is the ground of use genetic engineering constructions (GEC) as control samples 
      (PCS and ICS) on evaluation of diagnostic kits for reveal of RNA of hazard and 
      extremely hazard agents of virus infections by RT-PCR. The vector recombinant 
      plasmids, containing the insertion of cDNA of agent s genomic RNA are used as 
      PCS, RNA was packed in membrane protein of MS2 bacteriophage, is used as ICS. It 
      is demonstrated that ICS does no influence on sensitivity of RT-PCR both for use 
      of native agents and for use of synthetic nucleic acids of Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, 
      Machupo, Venezuelan encephalitis equine (VEE), Rift Valley fever and rabies 
      viruses. The possibility of use of PCS and ICS for standardization of diagnostic 
      kits is discussed.

TI  - NK Cells Accumulate in Infected Tissues and Contribute to Pathogenicity of Ebola 
      Virus in Mice.

LID - e01703-18
AB  - Understanding the immune parameters responsible for survival following Ebola 
      virus (EBOV) infection is paramount for developing countermeasures. In lethal 
      EBOV infections, levels of both NK and T cells decline drastically in the 
      circulation and lymphoid tissues before death. However, the fate of these 
      lymphocytes in viral replication sites remains unknown. In this study, reverse 
      transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) 
      analysis were used to investigate lymphocyte frequencies in various infected 
      mouse tissues after challenge with mouse-adapted EBOV (MA-EBOV). A decrease in NK 
      cell numbers from systemic circulation was observed concomitant to an increase of 
      these cells in tissues that are supporting active replication of EBOV. 
      Unexpectedly, NK accumulation in virus replication sites correlated with enhanced 
      EBOV disease progression in specific conditions; at a high challenge dose, 
      NK-depleted mice displayed lower viremia and liver damage and higher hepatic T 
      cell levels. Upregulation of UL16 binding protein 1 (ULBP-1) was detected in 
      hepatic T cells, suggesting that NK cells participate in their elimination. 
      Overall, this study supports the concept that NK cells accumulate in 
      EBOV-infected tissues and can contribute to viral pathogenicity.IMPORTANCE Ebola 
      virus (EBOV) outbreaks can claim numerous lives and also devastate the local 
      health infrastructure, as well as the economy, of affected countries. Lethal EBOV 
      infection has been documented to decrease the levels of several immune cells in 
      the blood that are necessary to defend the host. This decrease in immune cells 
      is, however, not observed in individuals who survive EBOV infection. Having a 
      better grasp of how these immune cells are lost is therefore of high importance 
      to develop and improve new and existing therapeutics. The significance of our 
      research is in identifying the mechanism responsible for the apparent loss of 
      immune cells in lethal EBOV infection. This will allow therapeutic options aimed 
      at preventing the loss of these immune cells, therefore allowing infected 
      individuals to better fight the infection.

PG  - e0212113

LID - e0212113
AB  - BACKGROUND: Without an effective vaccine, as was the case early in the 2014-2016 
      Ebola Outbreak in West Africa, disease control depends entirely on interrupting 
      transmission through early disease detection and prompt patient isolation. 
      Lateral Flow Immunoassays (LFI) are a potential supplement to centralized 
      reference laboratory testing for the early diagnosis of Ebola Virus Disease 
      (EVD). The goal of this study was to assess the performance of commercially 
      available simple and rapid antigen detection LFIs, submitted for review to the 
      WHO via the Emergency Use Assessment and Listing procedure. The study was 
      performed in an Ebola Treatment Centre laboratory involved in EVD testing in 
      Sierra Leone. In light of the current Ebola outbreak in May 2018 in the 
      Democratic Republic of Congo, which highlights the lack of clarity in the global 
      health community about appropriate Ebola diagnostics, our findings are 
      increasingly critical. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess 
      comparative performance of four LFIs for detecting EVD. LFIs were assessed 
      against the same 328 plasma samples and 100 whole EDTA blood samples, using the 
      altona RealStar Filovirus Screen real-time RT-PCR as the bench mark assay. The 
      performance of the Public Health England (PHE) in-house Zaire ebolavirus-specific 
      real time RT-PCR Trombley assay was concurrently assessed. Statistical analysis 
      using generalized estimating equations was conducted to compare LFI performance. 
      FINDINGS: Sensitivity and specificity varied between the LFIs, with specificity 
      found to be significantly higher for whole EDTA blood samples compared to plasma 
      samples in at least 2 LFIs (P</=0.003). Using the altona RT-PCR assay as the bench 
      mark, sensitivities on plasma samples ranged from 79.53% (101/127, 95% CI: 
      71.46-86.17%) for the DEDIATEST EBOLA (SD Biosensor) to 98.43% (125/127, 95% CI: 
      94.43-99.81%) for the One step Ebola test (Intec). Specificities ranged from 
      80.20% (158/197, 95% CI: 74.07-88.60%) for plasma samples using the ReEBOV 
      Antigen test Kit (Corgenix) to 100.00% (98/98, 95% CI: 96.31-100.00%) for whole 
      blood samples using the DEDIATEST EBOLA (SD Biosensor) and SD Ebola Zaire Ag (SD 
      Biosensor). Results also showed the Trombley RT-PCR assay had a lower limit of 
      detection than the altona assay, with some LFIs having higher sensitivity than 
      the altona assay when the Trombley assay was the bench mark. INTERPRETATION: All 
      of the tested EVD LFIs may be considered suitable for use in an outbreak 
      situation (i.e. rule out testing in communities), although they had variable 
      performance characteristics, with none possessing both high sensitivity and 
      specificity. The non-commercial Trombley Zaire ebolavirus RT-PCR assay warrants 
      further investigation, as it appeared more sensitive than the current gold 
      standard, the altona Filovirus Screen RT-PCR assay.

AB  - Lassa fever virus (LASV) causes acute viral haemorrhagic fever with symptoms 
      similar to those seen with Ebola virus infections. LASV is endemic to West Africa 
      and is transmitted through contact with excretions of infected Mastomys 
      natalensis rodents and other rodent species. Due to a high fatality rate, lack of 
      treatment options and difficulties with prevention and control, LASV is one of 
      the high-priority pathogens included in the WHO R&D Blueprint. The WHO LASV 
      vaccine strategy relies on availability of effective diagnostic tests. Current 
      diagnostics for LASV include in-house and commercial (primarily research-only) 
      laboratory-based serological and nucleic acid amplification tests. There are two 
      commercially available (for research use only) rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and 
      a number of multiplex panels for differential detection of LASV infection from 
      other endemic diseases with similar symptoms have been evaluated. However, a 
      number of diagnostic gaps remain. Lineage detection is a challenge due to the 
      genomic diversity of LASV, as pan-lineage sensitivity for both molecular and 
      immunological detection is necessary for surveillance and outbreak response. 
      While pan-lineage ELISA and RDTs are commercially available (for research use 
      only), validation and external quality assessment (EQA) is needed to confirm 
      detection sensitivity for all known or relevant strains. Variable sensitivity of 
      LASV PCR tests also highlights the need for improved validation and EQA. Given 
      that LASV outbreaks typically occur in low-resource settings, more options for 
      point-of-care testing would be valuable. These requirements should be taken into 
      account in target product profiles for improved LASV diagnostics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the five decades since their discovery, filoviruses of four 
      species have caused human hemorrhagic fever outbreaks: Marburg (MARV) 
      marburgvirus, and Zaire (EBOV), Sudan (SUDV) and Bundybugyo (BDBV) ebolaviruses. 
      The largest, devastating EBOV epidemic in West Africa in 2014-16, has been 
      followed by outbreaks of MARV in Uganda, 2017, and EBOV in Democratic Republic of 
      Congo, 2018, emphasizing the need to develop preparedness to diagnose all 
      filoviruses. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to optimize a new filovirus 
      RT-qPCR to detect all filoviruses, define its limits of detection (LOD) and 
      perform a field evaluation with outbreak samples. STUDY DESIGN: A pan-filovirus 
      RT-qPCR targeting the L gene was developed and evaluated within the EbolaMoDRAD 
      (Ebola virus: modern approaches for developing bedside rapid diagnostics) 
      project. Specificity and sensitivity were determined and the effect of 
      inactivation and PCR reagents (liquid and lyophilized format) were tested. 
      RESULTS: The LODs for the lyophilized pan-filovirus L-RT-qPCR assay were 9.4 
      copies per PCR reaction for EBOV, 9.9 for MARV, 1151 for SUDV, 65 for BDBV and 
      289 for Tai Forest virus. The test was set at the Pasteur Institute, Dakar, 
      Senegal, and 83 Ebola patient samples, with viral load ranging from 5 to 5 
      million copies of EBOV per reaction, were screened. The results for the patient 
      samples were in 100% concordance with the reference EBOV-specific assay. 
      DISCUSSION: Overall, the assay showed good sensitivity and specificity, covered 
      all filoviruses known to be human pathogens, performed well both in lyophilized 
      and liquid-phase formats and with EBOV outbreak clinical samples.

AB  - The 2014-16 outbreak of ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa resulted in 
      11,308 deaths. During the outbreak only 60% of patients were laboratory confirmed 
      and global health authorities have identified the need for accurate and readily 
      deployable molecular diagnostics as an important component of the ideal response 
      to future outbreaks, to quickly identify and isolate patients. Areas covered: 
      Currently PCR-based techniques and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) that detect 
      antigens specific to EVD infections dominate the diagnostic landscape, but recent 
      advances in biosensor technologies have led to novel approaches for the 
      development of EVD diagnostics. This review summarises the literature and 
      available performance data of currently available molecular diagnostics for 
      ebolavirus, identifies knowledge gaps and maps out future priorities for research 
      in this field. Expert opinion: While there are now a plethora of diagnostic tests 
      for EVD at various stages of development, there is an acute need for studies to 
      compare their clinical performance, but the sporadic nature of EVD outbreaks 
      makes this extremely challenging, demanding pragmatic new modalities of research 
      funding and ethical/institutional approval, to enable responsive research in 
      outbreak settings. Retrospective head-to-head diagnostic comparisons could also 
      be implemented using biobanked specimens, providing this can be done safely.

AB  - Situated in southeastern Sierra Leone, Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) maintains 
      one of the world's only Lassa fever isolation wards and was a strategic Ebola 
      virus disease (EVD) treatment facility during the 2014 EVD outbreak. Since 2006, 
      the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium (VHFC) has carried out research activities 
      at KGH, capturing clinical and laboratory data for suspected cases of Lassa 
      fever. Here we describe the approach, progress, and challenges in designing and 
      maintaining a data capture and management system (DCMS) at KGH to assist 
      infectious disease researchers in building and sustaining DCMS in low-resource 
      environments. Results on screening patterns and case-fatality rates are provided 
      to illustrate the context and scope of the DCMS covered in this study. A medical 
      records system and DCMS was designed and implemented between 2010 and 2016 
      linking historical and prospective Lassa fever data sources across KGH Lassa 
      fever units and its peripheral health units. Data were captured using a case 
      report form (CRF) system, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate 
      readers, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines, blood chemistry analyzers, and 
      data auditing procedures. Between 2008 and 2016, blood samples for 4,229 
      suspected Lassa fever cases were screened at KGH, ranging from 219 samples in 
      2008 to a peak of 760 samples in 2011. Lassa fever case-fatality rates before and 
      following the Ebola outbreak were 65.5% (148/226) and 89.5% (17/19), 
      respectively, suggesting that fewer, but more seriously ill subjects with Lassa 
      fever presented to KGH following the 2014 EVD outbreak (p = .040). DCMS 
      challenges included weak specificity of the Lassa fever suspected case 
      definition, limited capture of patient survival outcome data, internet costs, 
      lapses in internet connectivity, low bandwidth, equipment and software 
      maintenance, lack of computer teaching laboratories, and workload fluctuations 
      due to variable screening activity. DCMS are the backbone of international 
      research efforts and additional literature is needed on the topic for 
      establishing benchmarks and driving goal-based approaches for its advancement in 
      developing countries.

PG  - 701-706
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiz107 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2017, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) recorded its 
      eighth Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, approximately 3 years after the 
      previous outbreak. METHODS: Suspect cases of EVD were identified on the basis of 
      clinical and epidemiological information. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
      reaction (RT-PCR) analysis or serological testing was used to confirm Ebola virus 
      infection in suspected cases. The causative virus was later sequenced from a 
      RT-PCR-positive individual and assessed using phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: 
      Three probable and 5 laboratory-confirmed cases of EVD were recorded between 27 
      March and 1 July 2017 in the DRC. Fifty percent of cases died from the infection. 
      EVD cases were detected in 4 separate areas, resulting in > 270 contacts 
      monitored. The complete genome of the causative agent, a variant from the 
      Zaireebolavirus species, denoted Ebola virus Muyembe, was obtained using 
      next-generation sequencing. This variant is genetically closest, with 98.73% 
      homology, to the Ebola virus Mayinga variant isolated from the first DRC 
      outbreaks in 1976-1977. CONCLUSION: A single spillover event into the human 
      population is responsible for this DRC outbreak. Human-to-human transmission 
      resulted in limited dissemination of the causative agent, a novel Ebola virus 
      variant closely related to the initial Mayinga variant isolated in 1976-1977 in 
      the DRC.

TI  - Medical countermeasures during the 2018 Ebola virus disease outbreak in the North

AB  - BACKGROUND: The real-time generation of information about pathogen genomes has 
      become a vital goal for transmission analysis and characterisation in rapid 
      outbreak responses. In response to the recently established genomic capacity in 
      the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we explored the real-time generation of 
      genomic information at the start of the 2018 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak 
      in North Kivu Province. METHODS: We used targeted-enrichment sequencing to 
      produce two coding-complete Ebola virus genomes 5 days after declaration of the 
      EVD outbreak in North Kivu. Subsequent sequencing efforts yielded an additional 
      46 genomes. Genomic information was used to assess early transmission, medical 
      countermeasures, and evolution of Ebola virus. FINDINGS: The genomic information 
      demonstrated that the EVD outbreak in the North Kivu and Ituri Provinces was 
      distinct from the 2018 EVD outbreak in Equateur Province of the Democratic 
      Republic of the Congo. Primer and probe mismatches to Ebola virus were identified 
      in silico for all deployed diagnostic PCR assays, with the exception of the 
      Cepheid GeneXpert GP assay. INTERPRETATION: The first two coding-complete genomes 
      provided actionable information in real-time for the deployment of the 
      rVSVDeltaG-ZEBOV-GP Ebola virus envelope glycoprotein vaccine, available 
      therapeutics, and sequence-based diagnostic assays. Based on the mutations 
      identified in the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein (GP(12)) observed in all 48 
      genomes, deployed monoclonal antibody therapeutics (mAb114 and ZMapp) should be 
      efficacious against the circulating Ebola virus variant. Rapid Ebola virus 
      genomic characterisation should be included in routine EVD outbreak response 
      procedures to ascertain efficacy of medical countermeasures. FUNDING: Defense 
      Biological Product Assurance Office.

TI  - Remote Laboratory Management: Respiratory Virus Diagnostics.
LID - 10.3791/59188 [doi]
AB  - An uptick in recent pandemics (Ebola, Zika, MERS, influenza, etc.) underlines the 
      need for a more 'nimble,' coordinated response that addresses a multitude of 
      issues ranging from transportation, access, facilities, equipment, and 
      communication to provider training. To address this need, we have developed an 
      innovative, scalable, logistics-enhanced, mobile, laboratory facility for 
      emergencies and epidemics in resource-constrained global settings. Utilizing a 
      background in clinical operations as an academic medical center, we designed a 
      rapidly-deployable, modular BSL-2 and BSL-3 facility with user-friendly software 
      for tracking and management of drugs and supplies in remote regions during 
      epidemics and outbreaks. Here, we present our intermodal, mobile, expandable 
      shipping-container laboratory units. The design of the laboratory facilitates 
      off-grid usage by minimizing power consumption and allowing alternate water 
      sources. The unit's information communication technology (ICT) platform provides 
      (i) user-friendly tablet-based documentation, (ii) enhanced tracking of patients 
      and supplies, and (iii) integrated communication onsite with built-in telehealth 
      capabilities. To ensure quality in remote environments, we have developed a 
      checklist for a basic laboratory workflow and a protocol for respiratory viral 
      diagnosis using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). As 
      described, this innovative and comprehensive approach allows for the provision of 
      laboratory capability in resource-limited global environments.

AB  - The development of point-of-care (POC) diagnostic systems has received 
      well-deserved attention in recent years in the scientific literature, and many 
      experimental systems show great promise in real settings. However, in the case of 
      an epidemic emergency (or a natural disaster), the first line of response should 
      be based on commercially available and validated resources. Here, we compare the 
      performance and ease of use of the miniPCR, a recently commercially available 
      compact and portable PCR device, and a conventional thermocycler for the 
      diagnostics of viral nucleic acids. We used both thermocyclers to detect and 
      amplify Ebola and Zika DNA sequences of different lengths (in the range of 91 to 
      300 nucleotides) at different concentrations (in the range of ~50 to 4.0 x 108 
      DNA copies). Our results suggest that the performance of both thermocyclers is 
      quite similar. Moreover, the portability, ease of use, and reproducibility of the 
      miniPCR makes it a reliable alternative for point-of-care nucleic acid detection 
      and amplification.

AB  - To achieve maximum transmission chain tracking in the current Ebola outbreak, 
      whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been proposed to provide optimal information. 
      However, WGS remains a costly and time-intensive procedure that is poorly suited 
      for the large numbers of samples being generated, especially under severe time 
      and work-environment constraints as in the present DRC outbreak. To better 
      prepare for future outbreaks, where an apparent single outbreak may actually 
      represent overlapping outbreaks caused by independent variants, and where rapid 
      identification of emerging new transmission chains will be essential, a more 
      practical method would be to amplify and sequence genomic areas that reveal the 
      highest information to differentiate EBOV variants. We have identified four 
      highly informative polymorphism PCR sequencing targets, suitable for rapid 
      tracing of transmission chains and identification of new sources of Ebola 
      outbreaks, an approach which will be far more practical in the field than WGS.

TI  - Ultrasensitive Ebola Virus Antigen Sensing via 3D Nanoantenna Arrays.
PG  - e1902331
LID - 10.1002/adma.201902331 [doi]
AB  - Sensitive detection of pathogens is crucial for early disease diagnosis and 
      quarantine, which is of tremendous need in controlling severe and fatal illness 
      epidemics such as of Ebola virus (EBOV) disease. Serology assays can detect 
      EBOV-specific antigens and antibodies cost-effectively without sophisticated 
      equipment; however, they are less sensitive than reverse transcriptase polymerase 
      chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. Herein, a 3D plasmonic nanoantenna assay sensor is 
      developed as an on-chip immunoassay platform for ultrasensitive detection of 
      Ebola virus (EBOV) antigens. The EBOV sensor exhibits substantial fluorescence 
      intensity enhancement in immunoassays compared to flat gold substrate. The 
      nanoantenna-based biosensor successfully detects EBOV soluble glycoprotein (sGP) 
      in human plasma down to 220 fg mL(-1) , a significant 240 000-fold sensitivity 
      improvement compared to the 53 ng mL(-1) EBOV antigen detection limit of the 
      existing rapid EBOV immunoassay. In a mock clinical trial, the sensor detects 
      sGP-spiked human plasma samples at two times the limit of detection with 95.8% 
      sensitivity. The results combined highlight the nanosensor's extraordinary 
      capability of detecting EBOV antigen at ultralow concentration compared to 
      existing immunoassay methods. It is a promising next-generation bioassay platform 
      for early-stage disease diagnosis and pathogen detection for both public health 
      and national security applications.

TI  - Sequencing of mRNA from Whole Blood using Nanopore Sequencing.
LID - 10.3791/59377 [doi]
AB  - Sequencing in remote locations and resource-poor settings presents unique 
      challenges. Nanopore sequencing can be successfully used under such conditions, 
      and was deployed to West Africa during the recent Ebola virus epidemic, 
      highlighting this possibility. In addition to its practical advantages (low cost, 
      ease of equipment transport and use), this technology also provides fundamental 
      advantages over second-generation sequencing approaches, particularly the very 
      long read length, ability to directly sequence RNA, and real-time availability of 
      data. Raw read accuracy is lower than with other sequencing platforms, which 
      represents the main limitation of this technology; however, this can be partially 
      mitigated by the high read depth generated. Here, we present a field-compatible 
      protocol for sequencing of the mRNAs encoding for Niemann-Pick C1, which is the 
      cellular receptor for ebolaviruses. This protocol encompasses extraction of RNA 
      from animal blood samples, followed by RT-PCR for target enrichment, barcoding, 
      library preparation, and the sequencing run itself, and can be easily adapted for 
      use with other DNA or RNA targets.

TI  - Detection of Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever cases in a severe undifferentiated 
      febrile illness outbreak in the Federal Republic of Sudan: A retrospective 
      epidemiological and diagnostic cohort study.
PG  - e0007571
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0007571 [doi]
LID - e0007571
AB  - BACKGROUND: Undifferentiated febrile illness (UFI) is one of the most common 
      reasons for people seeking healthcare in low-income countries. While illness and 
      death due to specific infections such as malaria are often well-quantified, 
      others are frequently uncounted and their impact underappreciated. A number of 
      high consequence infectious diseases, including Ebola virus, are endemic or 
      epidemic in the Federal Republic of Sudan which has experienced at least 12 UFI 
      outbreaks, frequently associated with haemorrhage and high case fatality rates 
      (CFR), since 2012. One of these occurred in Darfur in 2015/2016 with 594 cases 
      and 108 deaths (CFR 18.2%). The aetiology of these outbreaks remains unknown. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We report a retrospective cohort study of the 
      2015/2016 Darfur outbreak, using a subset of 65 of 263 outbreak samples received 
      by the National Public Health Laboratory which met selection criteria of 
      sufficient sample volume and epidemiological data. Clinical features included 
      fever (95.8%), bleeding (95.7%), headache (51.6%) and arthralgia (42.2%). No 
      epidemiological patterns indicative of person-to-person transmission or 
      health-worker cases were reported. Samples were tested at the Public Health 
      England Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory using a bespoke panel of likely 
      pathogens including haemorrhagic fever viruses, arboviruses and Rickettsia, 
      Leptospira and Borrelia spp. Seven (11%) were positive for Crimean-Congo 
      haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) by real-time reverse transcription PCR. The 
      remaining samples tested negative on all assays. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: CCHFV 
      is an important cause of fever and haemorrhage in Darfur, but not the sole major 
      source of UFI outbreaks in Sudan. Prospective studies are needed to explore other 
      aetiologies, including novel pathogens. The presence of CCHFV has critical 
      infection, prevention and control as well as clinical implications for future 
      response. Our study reinforces the need to boost surveillance, lab and 
      investigative capacity to underpin effective response, and for local and 
      international health security.

TI  - Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing of the 2014 Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak 
      in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
LID - 10.1128/JCM.00827-19 [doi]
LID - e00827-19
AB  - We applied metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to detect Zaire Ebola 
      virus (EBOV) and other potential pathogens from whole-blood samples from 70 
      patients with suspected Ebola hemorrhagic fever during a 2014 outbreak in Boende, 
      Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and correlated these findings with 
      clinical symptoms. Twenty of 31 patients (64.5%) tested in Kinshasa, DRC, were 
      EBOV positive by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). Despite 
      partial degradation of sample RNA during shipping and handling, mNGS followed by 
      EBOV-specific capture probe enrichment in a U.S. genomics laboratory identified 
      EBOV reads in 22 of 70 samples (31.4%) versus in 21 of 70 (30.0%) EBOV-positive 
      samples by repeat qRT-PCR (overall concordance = 87.1%). Reads from Plasmodium 
      falciparum (malaria) were detected in 21 patients, of which at least 9 (42.9%) 
      were coinfected with EBOV. Other positive viral detections included hepatitis B 
      virus (n = 2), human pegivirus 1 (n = 2), Epstein-Barr virus (n = 9), and Orungo 
      virus (n = 1), a virus in the Reoviridae family. The patient with Orungo virus 
      infection presented with an acute febrile illness and died rapidly from massive 
      hemorrhage and dehydration. Although the patient's blood sample was negative by 
      EBOV qRT-PCR testing, identification of viral reads by mNGS confirmed the 
      presence of EBOV coinfection. In total, 9 new EBOV genomes (3 complete genomes, 
      and an additional 6 >/=50% complete) were assembled. Relaxed molecular clock 
      phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a molecular evolutionary rate for the Boende 
      strain 4 to 10x slower than that of other Ebola lineages. These results 
      demonstrate the utility of mNGS in broad-based pathogen detection and outbreak 
      surveillance.

TI  - Evaluation of Diagnostic Performance of Three Indirect Enzyme-Linked

      Sera.

AB  - Filovirus serological diagnosis and epidemiological investigations are hampered 
      due to the unavailability of validated immunoassays. Diagnostic performance of 
      three indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (I-ELISA) was evaluated for the 
      detection of IgG antibody to Ebola virus (EBOV) in human sera. One I-ELISA was 
      based on a whole EBOV antigen (WAg) and two utilized recombinant nucleocapsid 
      (NP) and glycoproteins (GP), respectively. Validation data sets derived from 
      individual sera collected in South Africa (SA), representing an EBOV non-endemic 
      country, and from sera collected during an Ebola disease (EBOD) outbreak in 
      Sierra Leone (SL), were categorized according to the compounded results of the 
      three I-ELISAs and real time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction 
      (RT-PCR). At the cut-off values selected at 95% accuracy level by the two-graph 
      receiver operating characteristic analysis, specificity in the SA EBOV negative 
      serum panel (n = 273) ranged from 98.17% (GP ELISA) to 99.27% (WAg ELISA). 
      Diagnostic specificity in the SL EBOV negative panel (n = 676) was 100% by the 
      three ELISAs. The diagnostic sensitivity in 423 RT-PCR confirmed EBOD patients 
      was dependent on the time when the serum was collected after onset of disease. It 
      significantly increased 2 weeks post-onset, reaching 100% sensitivity by WAg and 
      NP and 98.1% by GP I-ELISA.

AB  - Preparedness and response actions to mitigate Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks 
      rely on rapid diagnosis to be implemented locally to sort suspect patients 
      attending health centers. Our aim was (i) to develop and evaluate an RT-qPCR 
      assay combining primers and probes derived from two reference assays targeting 
      different genomic regions; (ii) to study whether sensitivity and specificity of 
      this dual-target assay were at least equal or better to the parental assays; 
      (iii) to implement this dual-target assay onto the Cepheid GeneXpert open 
      cartridge as a proof of principle for technological transfer aiming at bedsite 
      testing locally. To do so, three home-made published RT-qPCR assays were selected 
      to be compared with the RealStar((R)) Filovirus Screen RT-PCR kit 1.0 (Altona 
      Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany), a technique that was largely deployed during the 
      2014-2015 West African EVD outbreak. Primers and probes sequences of the 
      custom-made assays were analyzed in silico against a multiple sequence alignment, 
      including >250 complete sequences corresponding to strains that have caused EVD 
      epidemics in the past. Genomic RNA purified from the Mekambo strain of Zaire 
      ebolavirus (EBOV) was used to study the sensitivity of the five methods. Based on 
      these results, two in-house methods were selected and adapted to design the 
      dual-target assay, which performances were compared to those of the parental 
      assays using a synthetic RNA control. The dual-target assay showed better 
      sensitivity and limit of detection (LoD(95) at 0.4 copies/microL) than the parental 
      methods (1.7 and 2.2 copies/microL). Ultimately, the dual-target assay was 
      transferred onto the GeneXpert Flex-03 open cartridge, demonstrating a LoD(95) at 
      0.75 copies/microL. Together these results indicate that EBOV dual-target assay has 
      the potential to be used during EVD outbreak in the laboratory having performed 
      molecular testing during the recent outbreaks.

TI  - Hexamer phasing governs transcription initiation in the 3'-leader of Ebola virus.
PG  - 439-453
LID - 10.1261/rna.073718.119 [doi]
AB  - The genomic, bipartite replication promoter of Ebola virus (EBOV) consists of 
      elements 1 (PE1) and 2 (PE2). PE1 (55 nt at the 3'-terminus) is separated from 
      PE2 (harboring eight 3'-UN(5) hexamers) by the transcription start sequence (TSS) 
      of the first nucleoprotein (NP) gene plus a spacer sequence. Insertions or 
      deletions in the spacer were reported to support genome replication if comprising 
      6 or 12, but not 1/2/3/5/9 nt. This gave rise to the formulation of the "rule of 
      6" for the EBOV replication promoter. Here, we studied the impact of such hexamer 
      phasing on viral transcription using a series of replication-competent and 
      -deficient monocistronic minigenomes, in which the spacer of the NP gene was 
      mutated or replaced with that of internal EBOV genes and mutated variants 
      thereof. Beyond reporter gene assays, we conducted qRT-PCR to determine the 
      levels of mRNA, genomic and antigenomic RNA. We demonstrate that hexamer phasing 
      is also essential for viral transcription, that UN(5) hexamer periodicity extends 
      into PE1 and that the spacer region can be expanded by 48 nt without losses of 
      transcriptional activity. Making the UN(5) hexamer phasing continuous between PE1 
      and PE2 enhanced the efficiency of transcription and replication. We show that 
      the 2 nt preceding the TSS are essential for transcription. We further propose a 
      role for UN(5) hexamer phasing in positioning NP during initiation of RNA 
      synthesis, or in dissociation/reassociation of NP from the template RNA strand 
      while threading the RNA through the active site of the elongating polymerase 
      during replication and transcription.

AB  - Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), the shotgun sequencing of RNA and 
      DNA from clinical samples, has proved useful for broad-spectrum pathogen 
      detection and the genomic surveillance of viral outbreaks. An additional target 
      enrichment step is generally needed for high-sensitivity pathogen identification 
      in low-titre infections, yet available methods using PCR or capture probes can be 
      limited by high cost, narrow scope of detection, lengthy protocols and/or 
      cross-contamination. Here, we developed metagenomic sequencing with spiked primer 
      enrichment (MSSPE), a method for enriching targeted RNA viral sequences while 
      simultaneously retaining metagenomic sensitivity for other pathogens. We 
      evaluated MSSPE for 14 different viruses, yielding a median tenfold enrichment 
      and mean 47% (+/-16%) increase in the breadth of genome coverage over mNGS alone. 
      Virus detection using MSSPE arboviral or haemorrhagic fever viral panels was 
      comparable in sensitivity to specific PCR, demonstrating 95% accuracy for the 
      detection of Zika, Ebola, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses in plasma 
      samples from infected patients. Notably, sequences from re-emerging and/or 
      co-infecting viruses that have not been specifically targeted a priori, including 
      Powassan and Usutu, were successfully enriched using MSSPE. MSSPE is simple, low 
      cost, fast and deployable on either benchtop or portable nanopore sequencers, 
      making this method directly applicable for diagnostic laboratory and field use.

TI  - Utility of primary cells to examine NPC1 receptor expression in Mops condylurus, 
      a potential Ebola virus reservoir.

LID - e0007952
AB  - The significance of the integral membrane protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) in the 
      ebolavirus entry process has been determined using various cell lines derived 
      from humans, non-human primates and fruit bats. Fruit bats have long been 
      purported as the potential reservoir host for ebolaviruses, however several 
      studies provide evidence that Mops condylurus, an insectivorous microbat, is also 
      an ebolavirus reservoir. NPC1 receptor expression in the context of ebolavirus 
      replication in microbat cells remains unstudied. In order to study Ebola virus 
      (EBOV) cellular entry and replication in M. condylurus, we derived primary and 
      immortalized cell cultures from 12 different organs. The NPC1 receptor expression 
      was characterized by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry comparing the 
      expression levels of M. condylurus primary and immortalized cells, HeLa cells, 
      human embryonic kidney cells and cells from a European microbat species. EBOV 
      replication kinetics was studied for four representative cell cultures using 
      qRT-PCR. The aim was to elucidate the suitability of primary and immortalized 
      cells from different tissues for studying NPC1 receptor expression levels and 
      their potential influence on EBOV replication. The NPC1 receptor expression level 
      in M. condylurus primary cells differed depending on the organ they were derived 
      from and was for most cell types significantly lower than in human cell lines. 
      Immortalized cells showed for most cell types higher expression levels than their 
      corresponding primary cells. Concluding from our infection experiments with EBOV 
      we suggest a potential correlation between NPC1 receptor expression level and 
      virus replication rate in vitro.

AB  - Genomic surveillance during ebolavirus outbreaks to elucidate transmission chains 
      and develop diagnostic tests is delayed by the laborious development of 
      variant-specific laboratory assays. We developed a new protocol combining 31 
      parallel PCR assays with Illumina/MinION-based sequencing, allowing generic 
      ebolavirus genomic surveillance, validated using cell culture-derived Ebola, 
      Reston, Sudan and Tai Forest virus at concentrations compatible with patient 
      viral loads. Our approach enables pre-emptive genomic surveillance of ongoing and 
      future ebolavirus outbreaks irrespective of variant divergence.

TI  - Serological Evidence for Henipa-like and Filo-like Viruses in Trinidad Bats.
PG  - S375-S382
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiz648 [doi]
AB  - Bat-borne zoonotic pathogens belonging to the family Paramxyoviridae, including 
      Nipah and Hendra viruses, and the family Filoviridae, including Ebola and Marburg 
      viruses, can cause severe disease and high mortality rates on spillover into 
      human populations. Surveillance efforts for henipaviruses and filoviruses have 
      been largely restricted to the Old World; however, recent studies suggest a 
      potentially broader distribution for henipaviruses and filoviruses than 
      previously recognized. In the current study, we screened for henipaviruses and 
      filoviruses in New World bats collected across 4 locations in Trinidad near the 
      coast of Venezuela. Bat tissue samples were screened using previously established 
      reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. Serum were screened using 
      a multiplex immunoassay to detect antibodies reactive with the envelope 
      glycoprotein of viruses in the genus Henipavirus and the family Filoviridae. 
      Serum samples were also screened by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
      for antibodies reactive with Nipah G and F glycoproteins. Of 84 serum samples, 28 
      were reactive with >/=1 henipavirus glycoprotein by >/=1 serological method, and 6 
      serum samples were reactive against >/=1 filovirus glycoproteins. These data 
      provide evidence of potential circulation of viruses related to the henipaviruses 
      and filoviruses in New World bats.

TI  - Mucin-Like Domain of Ebola Virus Glycoprotein Enhances Selective Oncolytic 
      Actions against Brain Tumors.
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01967-19 [doi]
LID - e01967-19
AB  - Given that the Ebola virus (EBOV) infects a wide array of organs and cells yet 
      displays a relative lack of neurotropism, we asked whether a chimeric vesicular 
      stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) might selectively 
      target brain tumors. The mucin-like domain (MLD) of the EBOV GP may enhance virus 
      immune system evasion. Here, we compared chimeric VSVs in which EBOV GP replaces 
      the VSV glycoprotein, thereby reducing the neurotoxicity associated with 
      wild-type VSV. A chimeric VSV expressing the full-length EBOV GP (VSV-EBOV) 
      containing the MLD was substantially more effective and safer than a parallel 
      construct with an EBOV GP lacking the MLD (VSV-EBOVDeltaMLD). One-step growth, 
      reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, and Western blotting assessments showed 
      that VSV-EBOVDeltaMLD produced substantially more progeny faster than VSV-EBOV. Using 
      immunodeficient SCID mice, we focused on targeting human brain tumors with these 
      VSV-EBOVs. Similar to the findings of our previous study in which we used an 
      attenuated VSV-EBOV with no MLD that expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) 
      (VSV-EBOVDeltaMLD-GFP), VSV-EBOVDeltaMLD without GFP targeted glioma but yielded only a 
      modest extension of survival. In contrast, VSV-EBOV containing the MLD showed 
      substantially better targeting and elimination of brain tumors after intravenous 
      delivery and increased the survival of brain tumor-bearing mice. Despite the 
      apparent destruction of most tumor cells by VSV-EBOVDeltaMLD, the virus remained 
      active within the SCID mouse brain and showed widespread infection of normal 
      brain cells. In contrast, VSV-EBOV eliminated the tumors and showed relatively 
      little infection of normal brain cells. Parallel experiments with direct 
      intracranial virus infection generated similar results. Neither VSV-EBOV nor 
      VSV-EBOVDeltaMLD showed substantive infection of the brains of normal immunocompetent 
      mice.IMPORTANCE The Ebola virus glycoprotein contains a mucin-like domain which 
      may play a role in immune evasion. Chimeric vesicular stomatitis viruses with the 
      EBOV glycoprotein substituted for the VSV glycoprotein show greater safety and 
      efficacy in targeting brain tumors in immunodeficient mice when the MLD was 
      expressed within the EBOV glycoprotein than when EBOV lacked the mucin-like 
      domain.

AB  - Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a severe and frequently lethal disease caused by 
      Ebola virus (EBOV). EVD outbreaks typically start from a single case of probable 
      zoonotic transmission, followed by human-to-human transmission via direct contact 
      or contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated fomites. EVD has a high 
      case-fatality rate; it is characterized by fever, gastrointestinal signs and 
      multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Diagnosis requires a combination of case 
      definition and laboratory tests, typically real-time reverse transcription PCR to 
      detect viral RNA or rapid diagnostic tests based on immunoassays to detect EBOV 
      antigens. Recent advances in medical countermeasure research resulted in the 
      recent approval of an EBOV-targeted vaccine by European and US regulatory 
      agencies. The results of a randomized clinical trial of investigational 
      therapeutics for EVD demonstrated survival benefits from two monoclonal antibody 
      products targeting the EBOV membrane glycoprotein. New observations emerging from 
      the unprecedented 2013-2016 Western African EVD outbreak (the largest in history) 
      and the ongoing EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have 
      substantially improved the understanding of EVD and viral persistence in 
      survivors of EVD, resulting in new strategies toward prevention of infection and 
      optimization of clinical management, acute illness outcomes and attendance to the 
      clinical care needs of patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Detection of viral ribo-nucleic acid (RNA) via real-time polymerase 
      chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard for the detection of Ebola virus 
      (EBOV) during acute infection. However, the earliest window for viral RNA 
      detection in blood samples is 48-72 h post-onset of symptoms. Therefore, efforts 
      to develop additional orthogonal assays using complementary immunological and 
      serological technologies are still needed to provide simplified methodology for 
      field diagnostics. Furthermore, unlike RT-PCR tests, immunoassays that target 
      viral proteins and/or early host responses are less susceptible to sequence 
      erosion due to viral genetic drift. Although virus is shed into the bloodstream 
      from infected cells, the wide dynamic range of proteins in blood plasma makes 
      this a difficult sample matrix for the detection of low-abundant viral proteins. 
      We hypothesized that the isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), 
      which are the first cellular targets of the Ebola virus (EBOV), may provide an 
      enriched source of viral proteins. METHODS: A mouse infection model that employs 
      a mouse-adapted EBOV (MaEBOV) was chosen as a proof-of-principal experimental 
      paradigm to determine if viral proteins present in PBMCs can help diagnose EBOV 
      infection pre-symptomatically. We employed a liquid chromatography coupled with 
      tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) platform to provide both high sensitivity and 
      specificity for the detection and relative quantitation of viral proteins in 
      PBMCs collected during MaEBOV infection. Blood samples pooled from animals at the 
      post-infection time-points were used to determine the viral load by RT-PCR and 
      purify PBMCs. RESULTS: Using quantitative LC-MS/MS, we detected two EBOV proteins 
      (vp40 and nucleoprotein) in samples collected on Day 2 post-infection, which was 
      also the first day of detectable viremia via RT-PCR. These results were confirmed 
      via western blot which was performed on identical PBMC lysates from each 
      post-infection time point. CONCLUSIONS: While mass spectrometry is not currently 
      amenable to field diagnostics, these results suggest that viral protein 
      enrichment in PBMCs in tandem with highly sensitive immunoassays platforms, could 
      lead to the development of a rapid, high-throughput diagnostic platform for 
      pre-symptomatic detection of EBOV infection.

TI  - Assessment of the Angolan (CHERRT) Mobile Laboratory Curriculum for Disaster and 
      Pandemic Response.
PG  - 526-531
LID - 10.5811/westjem.2020.4.47385 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: As of April 5, 2020, the World Health Organization reported over 
      one million confirmed cases and more than 62,000 confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) 
      deaths affecting 204 countries/regions. The lack of COVID-19 testing capacity 
      threatens the ability of both the United States (US) and low middle income 
      countries (LMIC) to respond to this growing threat, The purpose of this study was 
      to assess the effectiveness through participant self-assessment of a rapid 
      response team (RRT) mobile laboratory curriculum METHODS: We conducted a pre and 
      post survey for the purpose of a process improvement assessment in Angola, 
      involving 32 individuals. The survey was performed before and after a 14-day 
      training workshop held in Luanda, Angola, in December 2019. A paired t-test was 
      used to identify any significant change on six 7-point Likert scale questions 
      with alpha< 0.05 (95% confidence interval). RESULTS: All six of the questions - 1) "I 
      feel confident managing a real laboratory sample test for Ebola or other highly 
      contagious sample;" 2) "I feel safe working in the lab environment during a real 
      scenario;" 3) "I feel as if I can appropriately manage a potentially highly 
      contagious laboratory sample;" 4)"I feel that I can interpret a positive or 
      negative sample during a suspected contagious outbreak;" 5) "I understand basic 
      Biobubble/mobile laboratory concepts and procedures;" and 6) "I understand 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) principles" - showed statistical significant 
      change pre and post training. Additionally, the final two questions - "I can more 
      effectively perform my role/position because of the training I received during 
      this course;" and "This training was valuable" - received high scores on the 
      Likert scale. CONCLUSION: This Angolan RRT mobile laboratory training curriculum 
      provides the nation of Angola with the confidence to rapidly respond and test at 
      the national level a highly infectious contagion in the region and perform 
      on-scene diagnostics. This mobile RRT laboratory provides a mobile and rapid 
      diagnostic resource when epidemic/pandemic resource allocation may need to be 
      prioritized based on confirmed disease prevalence.

TI  - Field evaluation of a Pan-Lassa rapid diagnostic test during the 2018 Nigerian 
      Lassa fever outbreak.

AB  - Lassa virus (LASV) is the causative agent of Lassa fever (LF), an often-fatal 
      hemorrhagic disease. LF is endemic in Nigeria, Sierra Leone and other West 
      African countries. Diagnosis of LASV infection is challenged by the genetic 
      diversity of the virus, which is greatest in Nigeria. The ReLASV Pan-Lassa 
      Antigen Rapid Test (Pan-Lassa RDT) is a point-of-care, in vitro diagnostic test 
      that utilizes a mixture of polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant 
      nucleoproteins of representative strains from the three most prevalent LASV 
      lineages (II, III and IV). We compared the performance of the Pan-LASV RDT to 
      available quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays during the 2018 LF outbreak in Nigeria. 
      For patients with acute LF (RDT positive, IgG/IgM negative) during initial 
      screening, RDT performance was 83.3% sensitivity and 92.8% specificity when 
      compared to composite results of two qPCR assays. 100% of samples that gave Ct 
      values below 22 on both qPCR assays were positive on the Pan-Lassa RDT. There 
      were significantly elevated case fatality rates and elevated liver transaminase 
      levels in subjects whose samples were RDT positive compared to RDT negative.

TI  - Nanopore Sequencing in a Clinical Routine Laboratory: Challenges and 
      Opportunities.
LID - 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2019.191114 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: About forty-five years ago the advent of Sanger sequencing (Sanger 
      and Coulson 1975) was revolutionary as it allowed deciphering of complete genome 
      sequences. A second revolution came when next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
      technologies accelerated and cheapened genome sequencing. Recently, third 
      generation/longread sequencing methods have appeared, which can directly detect 
      epigenetic modifications on native DNA and allow whole-transcript sequencing 
      without the need for assembly. Nanopore sequencing is one of these 
      third-generation approaches, enabling a single molecule of DNA or RNA to be 
      sequenced in real-time without the need for PCR amplification or chemical 
      labelling of the sample. It works by monitoring changes to an electrical current 
      as nucleic acids are passed through protein or synthetic nanopores. METHODS: A 
      literature search was performed in order to collect and summarize current 
      information about the methodological aspects of nanopore sequencing as well as 
      some application examples. RESULTS: The review describes concisely and 
      comprehensibly the technical aspects of nanopore sequencing and stresses the 
      advantages and disadvantages of this technique thereby also giving examples of 
      their potential applications in the clinical routine laboratory as are rapid 
      identification of viral pathogens, monitoring Ebola, environmental and food 
      safety monitoring, human and plant genome sequencing, monitoring of antibiotic 
      resistance, and other applications. CONCLUSIONS: It is a useful incitation for 
      such ones being permanently in search of upgrading their laboratory.

AB  - SUMMARYIn recent decades, several new diseases have emerged in different 
      geographical areas, with pathogens including Ebola virus, Zika virus, Nipah 
      virus, and coronaviruses (CoVs). Recently, a new type of viral infection emerged 
      in Wuhan City, China, and initial genomic sequencing data of this virus do not 
      match with previously sequenced CoVs, suggesting a novel CoV strain (2019-nCoV), 
      which has now been termed severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
      Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is suspected to originate from an 
      animal host (zoonotic origin) followed by human-to-human transmission, the 
      possibility of other routes should not be ruled out. Compared to diseases caused 
      by previously known human CoVs, COVID-19 shows less severe pathogenesis but 
      higher transmission competence, as is evident from the continuously increasing 
      number of confirmed cases globally. Compared to other emerging viruses, such as 
      Ebola virus, avian H7N9, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 has shown relatively low pathogenicity and 
      moderate transmissibility. Codon usage studies suggest that this novel virus has 
      been transferred from an animal source, such as bats. Early diagnosis by 
      real-time PCR and next-generation sequencing has facilitated the identification 
      of the pathogen at an early stage. Since no antiviral drug or vaccine exists to 
      treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2, potential therapeutic strategies that are currently 
      being evaluated predominantly stem from previous experience with treating 
      SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other emerging viral diseases. In this review, we address 
      epidemiological, diagnostic, clinical, and therapeutic aspects, including 
      perspectives of vaccines and preventive measures that have already been globally 
      recommended to counter this pandemic virus.

AB  - The outbreaks of Ebola virus between 2014 and 2020 have drawn attention to 
      knowledge gaps related to Ebola virus disease in pregnant women. The aim of this 
      study was to systematically evaluate available data on pregnant and lactating 
      women with acute Ebola virus disease or following recovery. We searched MEDLINE, 
      Embase, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), Web of Science Core Collection, CINAHL, 
      POPLINE, Global Health, and WHO Global Index Medicus, in addition to grey 
      literature, for relevant articles. Studies of all types and published between 
      database inception and Aug 19, 2019, were eligible (PROSPERO 129335). We 
      identified 1060 records, of which 52 studies met our inclusion criteria. Overall, 
      mortality in 274 pregnant women with Ebola virus disease was 72% (197 women 
      died); mortality for pregnant women with Ebola virus disease were not higher than 
      those in the general population of patients with Ebola virus disease. Nearly all 
      women with Ebola virus disease had adverse pregnancy outcomes. Among survivors, 
      Ebola virus RNA was detected by RT-PCR in amniotic fluid up to 32 days after 
      maternal clearance of Ebola virus from the blood and in breastmilk 26 days after 
      symptom onset. A risk of transmission of Ebola virus from pregnancy-related 
      fluids and breastmilk probably exists, and precautions should be taken.

AB  - In last five years, the Africa has faced two outbreaks of Zaire ebolavirus. These 
      outbreaks have been the largest so far, and latest outbreak is still ongoing and 
      affecting the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We tested in parallel three 
      different Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) realtime RT-PCRs targeting the nucleoprotein 
      gene (EBOV NP-RT-qPCRs) described by Trombley et al. (2010); Huang et al. (2012) 
      and Weidmann et al. (2004). These assays are used regularly in diagnostic 
      laboratories. The limit of detection (LOD), intra-assay repeatability using 
      different matrixes, sensitivity and specificity were determined. In addition, the 
      primers and probes were aligned with the sequences available in ongoing and past 
      outbreaks in order to check the mismatches. The specificity of all three EBOV 
      NP-RT-qPCRs were excellent (100 %), and LODs were under or 10 copies per PCR 
      reaction. Intra-assay repeatability was good in all assays, however the Ct-values 
      were bit higher using the EDTA-blood based matrix. All of the primers and probes 
      in EBOV NP-RT-qPCR assays have one or more mismatches in the probes and primers 
      when the 2267 Zaire EBOV NP sequences, including strains Ituri from DRC outbreak 
      (year 2018), was aligned. The EBOV strain of Bikoro (year 2018) circulating in 
      DRC was 100 % match in Trombley and Weidmann assay, but had one mismatch in Huang 
      assay.

AB  - We first conducted time-series analysis of mono- and dinucleotide composition for 
      over 10,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, as well as over 1500 Zaire ebolavirus genomes, 
      and found clear time-series changes in the compositions on a monthly basis, which 
      should reflect viral adaptations for efficient growth in human cells. We next 
      developed a sequence alignment free method that extensively searches for 
      advantageous mutations and rank them in an increase level for their 
      intrapopulation frequency. Time-series analysis of occurrences of 
      oligonucleotides of diverse lengths for SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed seven 
      distinctive mutations that rapidly expanded their intrapopulation frequency and 
      are thought to be candidates of advantageous mutations for the efficient growth 
      in human cells.

TI  - Recent Progress in Plasmonic Biosensing Schemes for Virus Detection.
LID - 10.3390/s20174745 [doi]

AB  - The global burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to public health and 
      global economy has stressed the need for rapid and simple diagnostic methods. 
      From this perspective, plasmonic-based biosensing can manage the threat of 
      infectious diseases by providing timely virus monitoring. In recent years, many 
      plasmonics' platforms have embraced the challenge of offering on-site strategies 
      to complement traditional diagnostic methods relying on the polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). This review 
      compiled recent progress on the development of novel plasmonic sensing schemes 
      for the effective control of virus-related diseases. A special focus was set on 
      the utilization of plasmonic nanostructures in combination with other detection 
      formats involving colorimetric, fluorescence, luminescence, or Raman scattering 
      enhancement. The quantification of different viruses (e.g., hepatitis virus, 
      influenza virus, norovirus, dengue virus, Ebola virus, Zika virus) with 
      particular attention to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) was reviewed from the perspective of the biomarker and the 
      biological receptor immobilized on the sensor chip. Technological limitations 
      including selectivity, stability, and monitoring in biological matrices were also 
      reviewed for different plasmonic-sensing approaches.

TI  - Bats as putative Zaire ebolavirus reservoir hosts and their habitat suitability 
      in Africa.

AB  - The genus Ebolavirus comprises some of the deadliest viruses for primates and 
      humans and associated disease outbreaks are increasing in Africa. Different 
      evidence suggests that bats are putative reservoir hosts and play a major role in 
      the transmission cycle of these filoviruses. Thus, detailed knowledge about their 
      distribution might improve risk estimations of where future disease outbreaks 
      might occur. A MaxEnt niche modelling approach based on climatic variables and 
      land cover was used to investigate the potential distribution of 9 bat species 
      associated to the Zaire ebolavirus. This viral species has led to major Ebola 
      outbreaks in Africa and is known for causing high mortalities. Modelling results 
      suggest suitable areas mainly in the areas near the coasts of West Africa with 
      extensions into Central Africa, where almost all of the 9 species studied find 
      suitable habitat conditions. Previous spillover events and outbreak sites of the 
      virus are covered by the modelled distribution of 3 bat species that have been 
      tested positive for the virus not only using serology tests but also PCR methods. 
      Modelling the habitat suitability of the bats is an important step that can 
      benefit public information campaigns and may ultimately help control future 
      outbreaks of the disease.

TI  - RNA secondary structure at the transcription start site influences EBOV 
      transcription initiation and replication in a length- and stability-dependent 
      manner.
PG  - 523-536
LID - 10.1080/15476286.2020.1818459 [doi]
AB  - Ebola virus (EBOV) RNA has the potential to form hairpin structures at the 
      transcription start sequence (TSS) and reinitiation sites of internal genes, both 
      on the genomic and antigenomic/mRNA level. Hairpin formation involving the TSS 
      and the spacer sequence between promotor elements (PE) 1 and 2 was suggested to 
      regulate viral transcription. Here, we provide evidence that such RNA structures 
      form during RNA synthesis by the viral polymerase and affect its activity. This 
      was analysed using monocistronic minigenomes carrying hairpin structure variants 
      in the TSS-spacer region that differ in length and stability. Transcription and 
      replication were measured via reporter activity and by qRT-PCR quantification of 
      the distinct viral RNA species. We demonstrate that viral RNA synthesis is 
      remarkably tolerant to spacer extensions of up to ~54 nt, but declines beyond 
      this length limit (~25% residual activity for a 66-nt extension). Minor 
      incremental stabilizations of hairpin structures in the TSS-spacer region and on 
      the mRNA/antigenomic level were found to rapidly abolish viral polymerase 
      activity, which may be exploited for antisense strategies to inhibit viral RNA 
      synthesis. Finally, balanced viral transcription and replication can still occur 
      when any RNA structure formation potential at the TSS is eliminated, provided 
      that hexamer phasing in the promoter region is maintained. Altogether, the 
      findings deepen and refine our insight into structure and length constraints 
      within the EBOV transcription and replication promoter and suggest a remarkable 
      flexibility of the viral polymerase in recognition of PE1 and PE2.

AB  - Ebola virus (EBOV) causes an extremely contagious viral haemorrhagic fever 
      associated with high mortality. While, historically, children have represented a 
      small number of total cases of Ebolavirus disease (EVD), in recent outbreaks up 
      to a quarter of cases have been in children. They pose unique challenges in 
      clinical management and infection prevention and control. In this review of 
      paediatric EVD, the epidemiology of past EVD outbreaks with specific focus on 
      children is discussed, the clinical manifestations and laboratory findings are 
      described and key developments in clinical management including specific topics 
      such as viral persistence and breastfeeding while considering unique psychosocial 
      and anthropological considerations for paediatric care including of survivors and 
      orphans and the stigma they face are discussed. In addition to summarising the 
      literature, perspectives based on the authors' experience of EVD outbreaks in the 
      Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are described.Abbreviations: ARDS: acute

TI  - Characteristics of Ebola Virus Disease Survivor Blood and Semen in Liberia: 
      Serology and Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).
PG  - e3641-e3646
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciaa1331 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ebola virus (EBOV), species Zaire ebolavirus, may persist in the 
      semen of male survivors of Ebola virus disease (EVD). We conducted a study of 
      male survivors of the 2014-2016 EVD outbreak in Liberia and evaluated their 
      immune responses to EBOV. We report here findings from the serologic testing of 
      blood for EBOV-specific antibodies, molecular testing for EBOV in blood and 
      semen, and serologic testing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a 
      subset of study participants. METHODS: We tested for EBOV RNA in blood by 
      quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and for 
      anti-EBOV-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies 
      by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for 126 study participants. We 
      performed PBMC analysis on a subgroup of 26 IgG-negative participants. RESULTS: 
      All 126 participants tested negative for EBOV RNA in blood by qRT-PCR. The blood 
      of 26 participants tested negative for EBOV-specific IgG antibodies by ELISA. 
      PBMCs were collected from 23/26 EBOV IgG-negative participants. Of these, 1/23 
      participants had PBMCs that produced anti-EBOV-specific IgG antibodies upon 
      stimulation with EBOV-specific glycoprotein (GP) and nucleoprotein (NP) antigens. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The blood of EVD survivors, collected when they did not have 
      symptoms meeting the case definition for acute or relapsed EVD, is unlikely to 
      pose a risk for EBOV transmission. We identified 1 IgM/IgG negative participant 
      who had PBMCs that produced anti-EBOV-specific antibodies upon stimulation. 
      Immunogenicity following acute EBOV infection may exist along a spectrum, and 
      absence of antibody response should not be exclusionary in determining an 
      individual's status as a survivor of EVD.

AB  - Sexual transmission of Ebola virus (EBOV) is well established and has been 
      implicated in multiple resurgences during the West African Ebola epidemic. Given 
      the persistence of viral RNA in semen, guidelines from the World Health 
      Organization (WHO) recommend abstinence or condom use for at least 1 year or 
      until two semen PCR tests are negative. To better understand the impact of semen 
      testing on sexual behavior, male EVD survivors were surveyed regarding their 
      sexual behavior before and after semen testing. Of the 171 men who enrolled, 148 
      reported being sexually active following discharge from an ETU with 59% reporting 
      episodes of condomless sex. At least one semen sample for testing was provided by 
      149 men and 13 of these men had EBOV RNA detected in their semen. When comparing 
      sexual behaviors before and after semen testing, a positive semen test result had 
      limited impact on behavior. Of those with seminal EBOV RNA detected, 61% reported 
      no change in behavior pre- and post-semen testing with 46% engaging in condomless 
      sex before and after testing and only 1 adopted safer sex behaviors following 
      receipt of a positive result. Similarly, among men with undetectable EBOV in 
      their semen, 66% reported no change in sexual behaviors with semen testing, with 
      55% forgoing condoms during sex. In only 11% was a negative semen result followed 
      by abandoning condoms. There were no known sexual transmission events of Ebola 
      virus in this cohort despite viral presence in semen during periods of condomless 
      sex. This highlights the need to better understand the infectious potential of 
      viral RNA persistence and determine what constitutes effective counseling for 
      survivors and their partners.

TI  - Comparative performance study of three Ebola rapid diagnostic tests in Guinea.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2014/15 Ebola outbreak in West Africa resulted in 11,000 deaths 
      and massive strain on local health systems, and the ongoing outbreak in 
      Democratic Republic of Congo has afflicted more than 3000 people. Accurate, rapid 
      Ebola diagnostics suitable for field deployment would enable prompt 
      identification and effective response to future outbreaks, yet remain largely 
      unavailable. The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of three novel 
      rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs): an Ebola, an Ebola-Malaria, and a Fever Panel test 
      that includes Ebola, all from a single manufacturer. METHODS: We evaluated the 
      three RDTs in 109 Ebola-positive and 96 Ebola-negative stored serum samples 
      collected during the outbreak in Guinea in 2014/15, and tested by real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Sensitivity, specificity, and overall percent 
      agreement were calculated for each RDT using RT-PCR as a reference standard, 
      stratified by Ct value ranges. RESULTS: All tests performed with high accuracy on 
      samples with low Ct value (high viral load). The Fever Panel test performed with 
      the highest accuracy, with a sensitivity of 89.9% and specificity of 90.6%. The 
      Ebola and Ebola-Malaria tests performed comparably to each other: sensitivity was 
      77.1 and 78% respectively, and specificity was 91.7% for the Ebola test and 95.8% 
      for the Ebola-Malaria test. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluated the accuracy of 
      three novel rapid diagnostic tests for Ebola. The tests may have significant 
      public health relevance, particularly the Fever Panel test, which detects seven 
      pathogens including Ebola. Given limitations to the study resulting from 
      uncertain sample quality, further evaluation is warranted. All tests performed 
      with highest accuracy on samples with low Ct value (high viral load), and the 
      data presented here suggests that these RDTs may be useful for point-of-care 
      diagnosis of cases in the context of an outbreak. Restrictions to their use in 
      non-severe Ebola cases or for longitudinal monitoring, when viral loads are 
      lower, may be appropriate. Highlighting the challenge in developing and 
      evaluating Ebola RDTs, there were concerns regarding sample integrity and 
      reference testing, and there is a need for additional research to validate these 
      assays.

AB  - The rapid detection of ongoing outbreak - and the identification of causative 
      pathogen - is pivotal for the early recognition of public health threats. The 
      emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases are linked to several 
      determinants, both human factors - such as population density, travel, and trade 
      - and ecological factors - like climate change and agricultural practices. 
      Several technologies are available for the rapid molecular identification of 
      pathogens [e.g. real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)], and together with on 
      line monitoring tools of infectious disease activity and behaviour, they 
      contribute to the surveillance system for infectious diseases. Web-based 
      surveillance tools, infectious diseases modelling and epidemic intelligence 
      methods represent crucial components for timely outbreak detection and rapid risk 
      assessment. The study aims to integrate the current prevention and control system 
      with a prediction tool for infectious diseases, based on regression analysis, to 
      support decision makers, health care workers, and first responders to quickly and 
      properly recognise an outbreak. This study has the intention to develop an 
      infectious disease regressive prediction tool working with an off-line database 
      built with specific epidemiological parameters of a set of infectious diseases of 
      high consequences. The tool has been developed as a first prototype of a software 
      solution called Infectious Diseases Seeker (IDS) and it had been established in 
      two main steps, the database building stage and the software implementation stage 
      (MATLAB((R)) environment). The IDS has been tested with the epidemiological data of 
      three outbreaks occurred recently: severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 
      China (2002-2003), plague outbreak in Madagascar (2017) and the Ebola virus 
      disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2018). The outcomes are 
      promising and they reveal that the software has been able to recognize and 
      characterize these outbreaks. The future perspective about this software regards 
      the developing of that tool as a useful and user-friendly predictive tool 
      appropriate for first responders, health care workers, and public health decision 
      makers to help them in predicting, assessing and contrasting outbreaks.

TI  - North American Big Brown Bats (Eptesicus fuscus) Harbor an Exogenous 
      Deltaretrovirus.
LID - 10.1128/mSphere.00902-20 [doi]
LID - e00902-20
AB  - Bats are the reservoir for a large number of zoonotic viruses, including members 
      of Coronaviridae (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] and 
      SARS-CoV-2), Paramyxoviridae (Hendra and Nipah viruses), Rhabdoviridae (rabies 
      virus), and Filoviridae (Ebola virus) as exemplars. Many retroviruses, such as 
      human immunodeficiency virus, are similarly zoonotic; however, only infectious 
      exogenous gammaretroviruses have recently been identified in bats. Here, viral 
      metagenomic sequencing of samples from bats submitted for rabies virus testing, 
      largely due to human exposure, identified a novel, highly divergent exogenous 
      Deltaretrovirus from a big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) in South Dakota. The 
      virus sequence, corresponding to Eptesicus fuscus deltaretrovirus (EfDRV), 
      comprised a nearly complete coding region comprised of canonical 
      5'-gag-pro-pol-env-3' genes with 37% to 51% identity to human T-lymphotropic 
      virus (HTLV), an infectious retrovirus that causes T-cell lymphoma. A putative 
      tax gene with 27% identity to HTLV was located downstream of the pol gene along 
      with a gene harbored in an alternative reading frame which possessed a conserved 
      domain for an Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen involved in gene 
      transactivation, suggesting a regulatory function similar to that of the 
      deltaretrovirus rex gene. A TaqMan reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) targeting 
      the pol gene identified 4/60 (6.7%) bats as positive for EfDRV, which, combined 
      with a search of the E. fuscus genome that failed to identify sequences with 
      homology to EfDRV, suggests that EfDRV is an infectious exogenous virus. As all 
      known members of Deltaretrovirus can cause malignancies and E. fuscus is widely 
      distributed in the Americas, often with a colonial roosting behavior in human 
      dwellings, further studies are needed to investigate potential 
      zoonosis.IMPORTANCE Bats host a large numbers of viruses, many of which are 
      zoonotic. In the United States, the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) is widely 
      distributed and lives in small colonies that roost in cavities, often in human 
      dwellings, leading to frequent human interaction. Viral metagenomic sequencing of 
      samples from an E. fuscus bat submitted for rabies testing identified the first 
      exogenous bat Deltaretrovirus The E. fuscus deltaretrovirus (EfDRV) genome 
      consists of the typical deltaretrovial 5'-gag-pro-pol-env-3' genes along with 
      genes encoding two putative transcriptional transactivator proteins distantly 
      related to the Tax protein of human T-cell lymphotrophic virus and nuclear 
      antigen 3B of Epstein-Barr virus. Searches of the E. fuscus genome sequence 
      failed to identify endogenous EfDRV. RT-PCR targeting the EfDRV pol gene 
      identified 4/60 (6.7%) bats with positive results. Together, these results 
      suggest that EfDRV is exogenous. As all members of Deltaretrovirus are associated 
      with T- and B-cell malignancies or neurologic disease, further studies on 
      possible zoonosis are warranted.

      glycosylated mucin-like domain (MLD) of the glycoprotein (GP), were expressed in 
      transgenic Nicotiana tabacum plants and designed as inexpensive and effective 
      diagnostic antibodies against Ebola virus disease (EVD). The first was anti-EBOV 
      13F6 full size antibody with heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) (monoclonal 
      antibody, mAb 13F6-FULL), while the second was a large single-chain (LSC) 
      antibody (mAb 13F6-LSC). mAb 13F6-LSC was constructed by linking the 13F6 LC 
      variable region (VL) with the HC of mAb 13F6-FULL using a peptide linker and 
      extended to the C-terminus using the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention motif 
      KDEL. Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation was employed to express the 
      antibodies in N. tabacum. PCR, RT-PCR, and immunoblot analyses confirmed the gene 
      insertion, transcription, and protein expression of these antibodies, 
      respectively. The antibodies tagged with the KDEL motif displayed high-mannose 
      type N-glycan structures and efficient binding to EBOV-like particles (VLPs). 
      Thus, various forms of anti-EBOV plant-derived mAbs 13F6-FULL and LSC with 
      efficient binding affinity to EBOV VLP can be produced in the plant system.

AB  - To help inform global guidelines on infant feeding, this systematic review 
      synthesizes evidence related to the presence of the Ebola virus (EBOV) in breast 
      milk and its potential risk of viral transmission to the infant when 
      breastfeeding. We relied on a comprehensive search strategy to identify studies 
      including women with suspected, probable, or confirmed EBOV infection, intending 
      to breastfeed or give breast milk to an infant. Our search identified 10,454 
      records, and after deduplication and screening, we assessed 148 full texts. We 
      included eight studies reporting on 10 breastfeeding mothers and their children 
      (one mother with twins), who provided breast milk samples for assessment. EBOV 
      was detected via RT-PCR or viral culture in seven out of ten breast milk samples. 
      Four out of the five-breastfed infants with EBOV-positive breast milk were found 
      positive for EBOV infection, and all of these EBOV-positive infants died. Since 
      previous reports have detected EBOV in tears, saliva, sweat, and contaminated 
      surfaces, with the current evidence, it is not possible to conclude with 
      certainty that breast milk was the main route of EBOV transmission.

AB  - Oral swabs are emerging as a non-invasive sample type for diagnosing infectious 
      diseases including Ebola, tuberculosis (TB), and COVID-19. To assure proper 
      sample collection, sample adequacy controls (SACs) are needed that detect 
      substances indicative of samples collected within the oral cavity. This study 
      evaluated two candidate SACs for this purpose. One detected representative oral 
      microbiota (Streptococcus species DNA) and the other, human cells (human 
      mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays for the two target cell 
      types were applied to buccal swabs (representing samples collected within the 
      oral cavity) and hand swabs (representing improperly collected samples) obtained 
      from 51 healthy U.S. volunteers. Quantification cycle (Cq) cutoffs that maximized 
      Youden's index were established for each assay. The streptococcal target at a Cq 
      cutoff of </=34.9 had 99.0% sensitivity and specificity for oral swab samples, 
      whereas human mtDNA perfectly distinguished between hand and mouth swabs with a 
      Cq cutoff of 31.3. The human mtDNA test was then applied to buccal, tongue, and 
      gum swabs that had previously been collected from TB patients and controls in 
      South Africa, along with "air swabs" collected as negative controls (total N = 
      292 swabs from 71 subjects). Of these swabs, 287/292 (98%) exhibited the expected 
      Cq values. In a paired analysis the three oral sites yielded indistinguishable 
      amounts of human mtDNA, however PurFlockTM swabs collected slightly more human 
      mtDNA than did OmniSwabsTM (p = 0.012). The results indicate that quantification 
      of human mtDNA cannot distinguish swabs collected from different sites within the 
      mouth. However, it can reliably distinguish oral swabs from swabs that were not 
      used orally, which makes it a useful SAC for oral swab-based diagnosis.

AB  - Emerging and re-emerging viral diseases poses a threat to living organisms, and 
      led to serious concern to humankind and public health. The last two decades, 
      viral epidemics such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) reported 
      in the years 2002-2003, and H1N1 influenza (Swine flu) in 2009, middle east 
      respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) from Saudi Arabia in 2012, Ebola virus in 
      2014-2016, and Zika virus in 2015. The recent outbreak of 2019-CoV-2 or severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2), novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, or 2019 
      disease, COVID-19) in Dec 2019, from, Wuhan city of China, has severe 
      implications of health concerns to the whole world, due to global spread and high 
      health risk. More than 423349 deaths had occurred globally and is still 
      increasing every day. The whole world is under a health emergency, and people are 
      advised to stay at their homes to avoid the spread of person-to-person infection, 
      and advised to maintain social distancing. The advancement in clinical diagnosis 
      techniques like Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR), immunological, microscopy, and geographic 
      information system (GIS) mapping technology helped in tacking the rapid diagnosis 
      and tracking viral infection in a short period. In the same way, artificial 
      intelligence (AI), combinatorial chemistry, and deep learning approaches help to 
      find novel therapeutics in less time and wide applicability in biomedical 
      research. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has 
      started the clinical trials of investigation COVID-19 vaccine. Therefore, we can 
      expect vaccines to be available for this deadly disease in the coming few months.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The second largest Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak began in the 
      Democratic Republic of Congo in July 2018 in North Kivu Province. Data suggest 
      the outbreak is not epidemiologically linked to the 2018 outbreak in Equateur 
      Province, and that independent introduction of Ebola virus (EBOV) into humans 
      occurred. We tested for antibodies to ebolaviruses in febrile patients seeking 
      care in North Kivu Province prior to the EVD outbreak. METHODS: Patients were 
      enrolled between May 2017 and April 2018, before the declared start of the 
      outbreak in eastern DRC. Questionnaires were administered to collect demographic 
      and behavioural information to identify risk factors for exposure. Biological 
      samples were evaluated for ebolavirus nucleic acid, and for antibodies to 
      ebolaviruses. Prevalence of exposure was calculated, and demographic factors 
      evaluated for associations with ebolavirus serostatus. RESULTS: Samples were 
      collected and tested from 272 people seeking care in the Rutshuru Health Zone in 
      North Kivu Province. All patients were negative for filoviruses by PCR. Intial 
      screening by indirect ELISA found that 30 people were reactive to EBOV-rGP. 
      Results were supported by detection of ebolavirus reactive linear peptides using 
      the Serochip platform. Differential screening of all reactive serum samples 
      against the rGP of all six ebolaviruses and Marburg virus (MARV) showed that 29 
      people exhibited the strongest reactivity to EBOV and one to Bombali virus 
      (BOMV), and western blotting confirmed results. Titers ranged from 1:100 to 
      1:12,800. Although both sexes and all ages tested positive for antibodies, women 
      were significantly more likely to be positive and the majority of positives were 
      in February 2018. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first documented evidence of 
      exposure to Ebola virus in people in eastern DRC. We detected antibodies to EBOV 
      in 10% of febrile patients seeking healthcare prior to the declaration of the 
      2018-2020 outbreak, suggesting early cases may have been missed or exposure 
      ocurred without associated illness. We also report the first known detection of 
      antibodies to BOMV, previously detected in bats in West and East Africa, and show 
      that human exposure to BOMV has occurred. Our data suggest human exposure to 
      ebolaviruses may be more frequent and geographically widespread.

      review.
PG  - 34-55
LID - 10.1039/d0ay01886d [doi]
AB  - RNA-based viruses likely make up the highest pandemic threat among all known 
      pathogens in about the last 100 years, since the Spanish Flu of 1918 with 50 M 
      deaths up to COVID-19. Nowadays, an efficient and affordable testing strategy for 
      such viruses have become the paramount target for the fields of virology and 
      bioanalytical chemistry. The detection of the viruses (influenza, hepatitis, HIV, 
      Zika, SARS, Ebola, SARS-CoV-2, etc.) and human antibodies to these viruses is 
      described and tabulated in terms of the reported methods of detection, time to 
      results, accuracy and specificity, if they are reported. The review is focused, 
      but not limited to publications in the last decade. Finally, the limits of 
      detection for each representative publication are tabulated by detection methods 
      and discussed. These methods include PCR, lateral flow immunoassays, LAMP-based 
      methods, ELISA, electrochemical methods (e.g., amperometry, voltammetry), 
      fluorescence spectroscopy, AFM, SPR and SERS spectroscopy, silver staining and 
      CRISPR-Cas based methods, bio-barcode detection, and resonance light scattering. 
      The review is likely to be interesting for various scientists, and particularly 
      helpful with information for establishing interdisciplinary research.

TI  - Persistence of Ebola virus in semen among Ebola virus disease survivors in Sierra 
      Leone: A cohort study of frequency, duration, and risk factors.
PG  - e1003273
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1003273 [doi]
LID - e1003273
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sexual transmission chains of Ebola virus (EBOV) have been verified 
      and linked to EBOV RNA persistence in semen, post-recovery. The rate of semen 
      persistence over time, including the average duration of persistence among Ebola 
      virus disease (EVD) survivors, is not well known. This cohort study aimed to 
      analyze population estimates of EBOV RNA persistence rates in semen over time, 
      and associated risk factors in a population of survivors from Sierra Leone. 
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this cohort study from May 2015 to April 2017 in Sierra 
      Leone, recruitment was conducted in 2 phases; the first enrolled 100 male 
      participants from the Western Area District in the capital of Freetown, and the 
      second enrolled 120 men from the Western Area District and from Lungi, Port Loko 
      District. Mean age of participants was 31 years. The men provided semen for 
      testing, analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) for the 
      presence of EBOV RNA. Follow-up occurred every 2 weeks until the endpoint, 
      defined as 2 consecutive negative qRT-PCR results of semen specimen testing for 
      EBOV RNA. Participants were matched with the Sierra Leone EVD case database to 
      retrieve cycle threshold (Ct) values from the qRT-PCR analysis done in blood 
      during acute disease. A purposive sampling strategy was used, and the included 
      sample composition was compared to the national EVD survivor database to 
      understand deviations from the general male survivor population. At 180 days (6 
      months) after Ebola treatment unit (ETU) discharge, the EBOV RNA semen positive 
      rate was 75.4% (95% CI 66.9%-82.0%). The median persistence duration was 204 
      days, with 50% of men having cleared their semen of EBOV RNA after this time. At 
      270 days, persistence was 26.8% (95% CI 20.0%-34.2%), and at 360 days, 6.0% (95% 
      CI 3.1%-10.2%). Longer persistence was significantly associated with severe acute 
      disease, with probability of persistence in this population at 1 year at 10.1% 
      (95% CI 4.6%-19.8%) compared to the probability approaching 0% for those with 
      mild acute disease. Age showed a dose-response pattern, where the youngest men 
      (</=25 years) were 3.17 (95% CI 1.60, 6.29) times more likely to be EBOV RNA 
      negative in semen, and men aged 26-35 years were 1.85 (95% CI 1.04, 3.28) times 
      more likely to be negative, than men aged >35 years. Among participants with both 
      severe acute EVD and a higher age (>35 years), persistence remained above 20% 
      (95% CI 6.0%-50.6%) at 1 year. Uptake of safe sex recommendations 3 months after 
      ETU discharge was low among a third of survivors. The sample was largely 
      representative of male survivors in Sierra Leone. A limitation of this study is 
      the lack of knowledge about infectiousness. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we 
      observed that EBOV RNA persistence in semen was a frequent phenomenon, with high 
      population rates over time. This finding will inform forthcoming updated 
      recommendations on risk reduction strategies relating to sexual transmission of 
      EBOV. Our findings support implementation of a semen testing program as part of 
      epidemic preparedness and response. Further, the results will enable planning of 
      the magnitude of testing and targeted counseling needs over time.

PG  - 595-598
LID - 10.1007/s40265-021-01483-4 [doi]
AB  - Ansuvimab (ansuvimab-zykl; EBANGA) is a human monoclonal antibody developed by 
      Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, which binds to the glycoprotein on Zaire ebolavirus 
      (Ebola virus) to block its entry into host cells. Ansuvimab has been recently 
      approved in the USA for the treatment of infection caused by Z. ebolavirus in 
      adult and paediatric patients, including in neonates born to a mother who is 
      RT-PCR positive for Z. ebolavirus infection, following the results of the PALM 
      phase II/III trial. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of 
      ansuvimab leading to this first approval for the treatment of infections caused 
      by Ebola virus in adults and paediatric patients.

TI  - Ultrasensitive point-of-care immunoassay for secreted glycoprotein detects Ebola 
      infection earlier than PCR.

AB  - Ebola virus (EBOV) hemorrhagic fever outbreaks have been challenging to deter due 
      to the lack of health care infrastructure in disease-endemic countries and a 
      corresponding inability to diagnose and contain the disease at an early stage. 
      EBOV vaccines and therapies have improved disease outcomes, but the advent of an 
      affordable, easily accessed, mass-produced rapid diagnostic test (RDT) that 
      matches the performance of more resource-intensive polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) assays would be invaluable in containing future outbreaks. Here, we 
      developed and demonstrated the performance of a new ultrasensitive point-of-care 
      immunoassay, the EBOV D4 assay, which targets the secreted glycoprotein of EBOV. 
      The EBOV D4 assay is 1000-fold more sensitive than the U.S. Food and Drug 
      Administration-approved RDTs and detected EBOV infection earlier than PCR in a 
      standard nonhuman primate model. The EBOV D4 assay is suitable for low-resource 
      settings and may facilitate earlier detection, containment, and treatment during 
      outbreaks of the disease.

AB  - Viruses are the causing agents for many relevant diseases, including influenza, 
      Ebola, HIV/AIDS, and COVID-19. Its rapid replication and high transmissibility 
      can lead to serious consequences not only to the individual but also to 
      collective health, causing deep economic impacts. In this scenario, diagnosis 
      tools are of significant importance, allowing the rapid, precise, and low-cost 
      testing of a substantial number of individuals. Currently, PCR-based techniques 
      are the gold standard for the diagnosis of viral diseases. Although these allow 
      the diagnosis of different illnesses with high precision, they still present 
      significant drawbacks. Their main disadvantages include long periods for 
      obtaining results and the need for specialized professionals and equipment, 
      requiring the tests to be performed in research centers. In this scenario, 
      biosensors have been presented as promising alternatives for the rapid, precise, 
      low-cost, and on-site diagnosis of viral diseases. This critical review article 
      describes the advancements achieved in the last five years regarding 
      electrochemical biosensors for the diagnosis of viral infections. First, 
      genosensors and aptasensors for the detection of virus and the diagnosis of viral 
      diseases are presented in detail regarding probe immobilization approaches, 
      detection methods (label-free and sandwich), and amplification strategies. 
      Following, immunosensors are highlighted, including many different construction 
      strategies such as label-free, sandwich, competitive, and lateral-flow assays. 
      Then, biosensors for the detection of viral-diseases-related biomarkers are 
      presented and discussed, as well as point of care systems and their advantages 
      when compared to traditional techniques. Last, the difficulties of 
      commercializing electrochemical devices are critically discussed in conjunction 
      with future trends such as lab-on-a-chip and flexible sensors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Marburg virus (MARV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) are acute infections with 
      high case fatality rates. It is of great significance for epidemic monitoring and 
      prevention and control of infectious diseases by the development of a rapid, 
      specific, and sensitive quantitative PCR method to detect two pathogens 
      simultaneously. METHODS: Primers and TaqMan probes were designed according to 
      highly conserved sequences of these viruses. Sensitivity, specificity, linear 
      range, limit of detection, and the effects of hemolysis and lipid on real-time 
      qPCR were evaluated. RESULTS: The linearity of the curve allowed quantification 
      of nucleic acid concentrations in range from 10(3) to 10(9)  copies/ml per 
      reaction (MARV and EBOV). The limit of detection of EBOV was 40 copies/ml, and 
      MARV was 100 copies/ml. It has no cross-reaction with other pathogens such as 
      hepatitis b virus (HBV), hepatitis c virus (HCV), human papillomavirus (HPV), 
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and 
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Repeatability analysis of the two viruses 
      showed that their coefficient of variation (CV) was less than 5.0%. The above 
      results indicated that fluorescence quantitative PCR could detect EBOV and MARV 
      sensitively and specifically. CONCLUSIONS: The TaqMan probe-based multiplex 
      fluorescence quantitative PCR assays could detect EBOV and MARV sensitively 
      specifically and simultaneously.

TI  - Designing Two Synthetic Constructs for Real Time PCR Detection of Francisella 
      tularensis and Ebola Virus.
PG  - 92-97
LID - 10.18502/ajmb.v13i2.5528 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Generally, timely diagnosis of micro-organisms is very important to 
      prevent many diseases. Many methods can detect micro-organisms like culture-based 
      methods and molecular methods. The molecular methods are usually preferred 
      because they provide fast and reliable results. In some cases, microbial strains 
      are not accessible, and there is no safety to work with them; therefore, 
      synthetic constructs which are designed according to the available sequences in 
      databases can be used as a positive control for detection of them. METHODS: In 
      this study, a synthetic construct was designed for molecular detection of 
      Francisella tularensis (F. tularensis) and the Ebola virus by multiplex real-time 
      PCR reaction. For this, sequences were taken from databases and then multiple 
      alignments were done by software. Also, conventional PCR and two models of 
      real-time PCR (SYBR green and TaqMan) were applied. Finally, multiplex real-time 
      PCR was performed. RESULTS: The synthetic construct was designed and used for 
      conventional PCR and multiplex PCR. The results of common PCR showed a single 
      band at 148 bp and 167 bp in 1.5% agarose gel stained by ethidium bromide for F. 
      tularensis and Ebola virus, respectively. Also, a dual-band at 148 and 167 bp was 
      observed in multiplex PCR. Results of real-time PCR showed a limit of detection 
      about 0.1 pg of plasmid/mul. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the designed construct can 
      be used as a positive control for an accurate diagnosis of these micro-organisms 
      without any biological danger for laboratory staff. So, this method is useful for 
      diagnosis of these agents in food, water, and blood samples.

AB  - BACKGROUND: West Africa has witnessed the unprecedented outbreak of Ebola virus 
      disease (EVD). The Ebola virus (EBOV) can cause Ebola hemorrhagic fever, which is 
      documented as the most deadly viral hemorrhagic fever in the world. RT-PCR had 
      been suggested to be employed in the detection of Ebola virus; however, this 
      method has high requirements for laboratory equipment and takes a long time to 
      determine Ebola infection. Although Xpert Ebola is a fast and simple instrument 
      for the detection of Ebola virus, its effect is still unclear. This study is 
      aimed at evaluating the accuracy of Xpert Ebola in diagnosing Ebola virus 
      infection. METHODS: Using the keywords "Xpert" and "Ebola virus", relevant 
      studies were retrieved from the database of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and 
      Cochrane. RT-PCR was employed as a reference standard to evaluate whether the 
      study is eligible to be included in the meta-analysis. Data from these included 
      studies were extracted by two independent assessors and were then analyzed by the 
      Meta-DiSc 1.4 software to produce the heterogeneity of sensitivity (SEN), 
      specificity (SP), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio 
      (NLR), and diagnostic advantage ratio (DOR) of the study. The results of pooled 
      analysis were plotted, together with the summary receiver operating 
      characteristic (SROC) curve plotted by calculating the area under the curve 
      (AUC). Generated pooled summary estimates (95% CIs) were calculated for the 
      evaluation of the overall accuracy of this study. RESULTS: Five fourfold tables 
      were made from the four studies that were included in the meta-analysis. The 
      pooled sensitivity of Xpert Ebola was 0.98 (95% confidence interval (CI) (0.95, 
      0.99)), and the pooled specificity was 0.98 (95% CI (0.97, 0.99)). The pooled 
      values of positive likelihood ratio was 53.91 (95% CI (12.82, 226.79)), with 
      negative likelihood ratio being 0.04 (95% CI (0.02, 0.08)) and diagnostic odds 
      ratio being 2649.45 (95% CI (629.61, 11149.02)). The AUC was 0.9961. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Compared with RT-PCR, Xpert Ebola has high sensitivity and specificity. 
      Therefore, it is a valued alternative method for the clinical diagnosis of Ebola 
      virus infection. However, the Xpert Ebola test is a qualitative test that does 
      not provide quantitative testing of EBOV concentration. Whether it can completely 
      replace other methods or not calls for further evidences.

AB  - With 12 of the 31 outbreaks, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is highly 
      affected by Ebolavirus disease (EVD). To better understand the role of bats in 
      the ecology of Ebola viruses, we conducted surveys in bats during two recent EVD 
      outbreaks and in two areas with previous outbreaks. Dried blood spots were tested 
      for antibodies to ebolaviruses and oral and rectal swabs were screened for the 
      presence of filovirus using a broadly reactive semi-nested RT-PCR. Between 2018 
      and 2020, 892 (88.6%) frugivorous and 115 (11.4%) insectivorous bats were 
      collected. Overall, 11/925 (1.2%) to 100/925 (10.8%) bats showed antibodies to at 
      least one Ebolavirus antigen depending on the positivity criteria. Antibodies 
      were detected in fruit bats from the four sites and from species previously 
      documented to harbor Ebola antibodies or RNA. We tested for the first time a 
      large number of bats during ongoing EVD outbreaks in DRC, but no viral RNA was 
      detected in the 676 sampled bats. Our study illustrates the difficulty to 
      document the role of bats as a source of Ebolaviruses as they might clear quickly 
      the virus. Given the increasing frequency of EVD outbreaks, more studies on the 
      animal reservoir are urgently needed.

LID - 10.1016/j.apsb.2021.02.010 [doi]
AB  - Recent infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19 and Ebola, have highlighted 
      the need for rapid and accurate diagnosis to initiate treatment and curb 
      transmission. Successful diagnostic strategies critically depend on the 
      efficiency of biological sampling and timely analysis. However, current 
      diagnostic techniques are invasive/intrusive and present a severe bottleneck by 
      requiring specialist equipment and trained personnel. Moreover, centralised test 
      facilities are poorly accessible and the requirement to travel may increase 
      disease transmission. Self-administrable, point-of-care (PoC) microneedle 
      diagnostic devices could provide a viable solution to these problems. These 
      miniature needle arrays can detect biomarkers in/from the skin in a minimally 
      invasive manner to provide (near-) real-time diagnosis. Few microneedle devices 
      have been developed specifically for infectious disease diagnosis, though similar 
      technologies are well established in other fields and generally adaptable for 
      infectious disease diagnosis. These include microneedles for biofluid extraction, 
      microneedle sensors and analyte-capturing microneedles, or combinations thereof. 
      Analyte sampling/detection from both blood and dermal interstitial fluid is 
      possible. These technologies are in their early stages of development for 
      infectious disease diagnostics, and there is a vast scope for further 
      development. In this review, we discuss the utility and future outlook of these 
      microneedle technologies in infectious disease diagnosis.

AB  - Ebola virus (EBOV), of the family Filoviridae, is an RNA virus that can cause a 
      hemorrhagic fever with a high mortality rate. Defective viral genomes (DVGs) are 
      truncated genomes that have been observed during multiple RNA virus infections, 
      including in vitro EBOV infection, and have previously been associated with viral 
      persistence and immunostimulatory activity. As DVGs have been detected in cells 
      persistently infected with EBOV, we hypothesized that DVGs may also accumulate 
      during viral replication in filovirus-infected hosts. Therefore, we interrogated 
      sequence data from serum and tissue samples using a bioinformatics tool in order 
      to identify the presence of DVGs in nonhuman primates (NHPs) infected with EBOV, 
      Sudan virus (SUDV), or Marburg virus (MARV). Multiple 5' copy-back DVGs (cbDVGs) 
      were detected in NHP serum during the acute phase of filovirus infection. While 
      the relative abundance of total DVGs in most animals was low, serum collected 
      during acute EBOV and SUDV infections, but not MARV infections, contained a 
      higher proportion of short trailer sequence cbDVGs than the challenge stock. This 
      indicated an accumulation of these DVGs throughout infection, potentially due to 
      the preferential replication of short DVGs over the longer viral genome. Using 
      reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and deep sequencing, we also confirmed the 
      presence of 5' cbDVGs in EBOV-infected NHP testes, which is of interest due to 
      EBOV persistence in semen of male survivors of infection. This work suggests that 
      DVGs play a role in EBOV infection in vivo and that further study will lead to a 
      better understanding of EBOV pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE The study of filovirus 
      pathogenesis is critical for understanding the consequences of infection and for 
      the development of strategies to ameliorate future outbreaks. Defective viral 
      genomes (DVGs) have been detected during EBOV infections in vitro; however, their 
      presence in in vivo infections remains unknown. In this study, DVGs were detected 
      in samples collected from EBOV- and SUDV-infected nonhuman primates (NHPs). The 
      accumulation of these DVGs in the trailer region of the genome during infection 
      indicates a potential role in EBOV and SUDV pathogenesis. In particular, the 
      presence of DVGs in the testes of infected NHPs requires further investigation as 
      it may be linked to the establishment of persistence.

TI  - Factors associated with length of stay and treatment outcome of Ebola patients 
      treated at an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone during the peak period of 
      the West African Ebola outbreak 2013-2016.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the West Africa Ebola 
      epidemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in August 2014. 
      During the outbreak period, there were calls for the affected countries to 
      construct Ebola treatment centres and reliable diagnostic laboratories closer to 
      areas of transmission in order to improve the quality care of Ebola Virus Disease 
      (EVD) patients. Delay in seeking treatment has been reported to have led to poor 
      treatment outcome of EVD patients. Sierra Leone recorded more than 8000 probable 
      and confirmed cases and more than 4000 EVD -related deaths nation-wide. METHODS: 
      In this retrospective study, we investigated the effects of treatment delay, 
      length of symptomatic period, EVD patients' sex, age, occupation, region of 
      residence, and clinical characteristics on the treatment outcome of 205 
      laboratory-confirmed EVD patients who were admitted at the Kenema Government 
      Hospital Ebola Treatment Center (KGHETC) from 13/09/2014-26/11/2014; i.e. during 
      the peak of 2013-2016 EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone. Specifically also, we 
      determined the factors that were associated with the length of stay for EVD 
      treatment for patients who were discharged alive. RESULTS: Majority (66.3%, 
      n = 205/309) of the 309 suspected EVD patients with medical records at the KGHETC 
      triage during the period under review were tested positive for EVD using 
      reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and had a definitive 
      treatment outcome. Few (33.7%, n = 104/309) suspected EVD patients were not 
      included in our analysis and were classified thus: 29.1% (n = 90/309) suspect EVD 
      cases with negative RT-PCR results, 4.5% (n = 14/309) suspect cases with 
      non-available RT-PCR result. Of the 205 patients, 99 (48.3%) had a fatal outcome. 
      For EVD patients that survived, we recorded a significant association (- 0.06, 
      95% Confidence Interval (CI) = - 0.14 - - 0.02, p = 0.004) between the Length of 
      Stay (LOS) and for each kilometer travelled to seek treatment at the KGHETC. 
      However, the association between EVD patients that were low skilled workers 
      (- 5.91, 95% CI = - 24.60 - 12.79, p = 0.73), EVD patients who were children and 
      pupils in junior school (- 0.86, 95% CI = - 12.86 - 11.14, p = 0.73), health 
      seeking delay for EVD patients who resided in Kenema District where the KGHETC 
      was located (- 0.49, 95% CI = - 0.12 - 1.09, p = 0.24), sex (- 1.77, 95% 
      CI = - 8.75 - 5.21, p = 0.50), age (0.21, 95% CI = - 0.36 - 0.77, p = 0.57), 
      referral status (1.21, 95% CI = - 17.67 - 20.09, p = 0.89) and the LOS in 
      surviving patients were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The high LOS 
      for either treatment outcome for EVD patients that resided in the district in 
      which the EVD treatment facility was located compared to those patients from 
      other districts implies that health authorities should consider intensive health 
      education with high priority given to seeking early EVD treatment, and the 
      construction of strategic ETCs as important components in their response 
      strategy.

AB  - HIGHLIGHTS: (1) Blood culture is the gold standard for the diagnosis of bacterial 
      infections. (2) Bone marrow culture is more sensitive than blood culture even in 
      patients with enteric fever receiving antibiotics. (3) Microscopic agglutination 
      test is considered the gold standard for diagnosing leptospirosis; however, now 
      IgM ELISA and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are more frequently used for 
      diagnosis. (4) Tuberculosis is diagnosed with the help of nucleic acid 
      amplification tests like Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra which also detects rifampicin 
      resistance. Other tests include microscopy, Lowenstein-Jensen and mycobacteria 
      growth indicator tube culture, line probe assay. (5) Tropical rickettsial 
      infections are diagnosed by serological reactions (Weil-Felix, ELISA for 
      antibodies) and PCR. (6) For Brucellosis culture from blood, bone marrow or 
      tissue specimens remain the mainstay in diagnosis. (7) Dengue, Zika, 
      Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ebola, hantavirus, rabies are diagnosed with 
      reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Serological tests like IgM ELISA 
      or paired sera samples for IgG are also used for diagnosis. HOW TO CITE THIS

AB  - Ebola virus infection causes severe hemorrhagic fever, and its mortality rates 
      varied from 25 to 90% in the previous outbreaks. The highly infectious and lethal 
      nature of this virus highlights the need for reliable and sensitive diagnostic 
      methods to distinguish it from other diseases present with similar clinical 
      symptoms. Based on multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and oligonucleotide 
      microarray technology, a cost-effective, multipathogen and high-throughput method 
      was developed for simultaneous detection of Ebola virus and other pathogens 
      associated with hemorrhagic fever, including Marburg virus, Lassa fever virus, 
      Junin virus, Machupo virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic 
      fever virus, malaria parasite, hantavirus, severe fever with thrombocytopenia 
      syndrome virus, dengue virus, yellow fever virus, Chikungunya virus, influenza A 
      virus, and influenza B virus. This assay had an excellent specificity for target 
      pathogens, without overlap signal between the probes. The limit of detection was 
      approximately 10(3) pathogen copies/mul. A total of 60 positive nucleic acid 
      samples for different pathogens were detected, a concordance of 100% was observed 
      between microarray assay and real-time PCR analysis. Consequently, the described 
      oligonucleotide microarray may be specific and sensitive assay for diagnosis and 
      surveillance of infections caused by Ebola virus and other species of hemorrhagic 
      fever pathogens.

AB  - Zaire ebolavirus has been responsible for several catastrophic outbreaks with a 
      high mortality rate. Unfortunately, there were no approved therapies or vaccines 
      to treat or prevent infections caused by Ebola virus (EBOV) or other filoviruses. 
      Atoltivimab/ maftivimab/odesivimab (Inmazeb) is the first Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for Zaire ebolavirus infection in adult 
      and pediatric patients, including neonates born to a mother who is reverse 
      transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive for Zaire ebolavirus 
      infection. The efficacy of Inmazeb has been established in vivo and it has 
      successfully completed a phase I clinical trial in healthy individuals with no 
      drug-related adverse effects. Additionally, Inmazeb has displayed significant 
      reduction in mortality in the PALM (PAmoja tuLinde Maisha) trial, when compared 
      with the control arm receiving ZMapp. Inmazeb has received orphan drug 
      designation from both the U.S. FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

TI  - The Rise of SARS-CoV-2 Variants and the Role of Convalescent Plasma Therapy for 
      Management of Infections.

AB  - Novel therapies for the treatment of COVID-19 are continuing to emerge as the 
      SARS-Cov-2 pandemic progresses. PCR remains the standard benchmark for initial 
      diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, while advances in immunological profiling are 
      guiding clinical treatment. The SARS-Cov-2 virus has undergone multiple mutations 
      since its emergence in 2019, resulting in changes in virulence that have impacted 
      on disease severity globally. The emergence of more virulent variants of 
      SARS-Cov-2 remains challenging for effective disease control during this 
      pandemic. Major variants identified to date include B.1.1.7, B.1.351; P.1; 
      B.1.617.2; B.1.427; P.2; P.3; B.1.525; and C.37. Globally, large unvaccinated 
      populations increase the risk of more and more variants arising. With successive 
      waves of COVID-19 emerging, strategies that mitigate against community 
      transmission need to be implemented, including increased vaccination coverage. 
      For treatment, convalescent plasma therapy, successfully deployed during recent 
      Ebola outbreaks and for H1N1 influenza, can increase survival rates and improve 
      host responses to viral challenge. Convalescent plasma is rich with cytokines 
      (IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-17, and IL-8), CCL2, and TNFalpha, neutralizing antibodies, 
      and clotting factors essential for the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
      Clinical trials can inform and guide treatment policy, leading to mainstream 
      adoption of convalescent therapy. This review examines the limited number of 
      clinical trials published, to date that have deployed this therapy and explores 
      clinical trials in progress for the treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - Given that ebolavirus causes severe and frequently lethal disease, its rapid and 
      accurate detection using available and validated methods is essential for 
      controlling infection. Real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) has proven to 
      be an invaluable tool for ebolaviruses diagnostics. Many assays with different 
      targets have been developed, but they have not been externally compared or 
      validated, and limits of detection are not uniformly reported. Here we compared 
      and evaluated the sensitivity, reproducibility and specificity of 23 in-house 
      assays under the same conditions. Our results showed that these assays were 
      highly gene- and species- specific when evaluated using in vitro RNA transcripts 
      and viral RNA, and the potential limits of detection were uniformly reported 
      ranging from 10(2) to 10(6) in vitro synthesized RNA transcripts copies permuL and 
      1-100 TCID(50)/mL. The comparison of these assays indicated that those targeting 
      the more conservative NP gene could be the better option for EVD case definition 
      and quantitative measurement because of its higher sensitivity for the same 
      species. Our analysis could contribute to the standardization of ebolavirus 
      detection and quantification assays, which can offer a better understanding of 
      the meaning of results across laboratories and time points, as well as make them 
      easy to implement, especially under outbreak conditions.

AB  - We first conducted time-series analysis of mono- and dinucleotide composition for 
      over 10,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, as well as over 1500 Zaire ebolavirus genomes, 
      and found clear time-series changes in the compositions on a monthly basis, which 
      should reflect viral adaptations for efficient growth in human cells. We next 
      developed a sequence alignment free method that extensively searches for 
      advantageous mutations and rank them in an increase level for their 
      intrapopulation frequency. Time-series analysis of occurrences of 
      oligonucleotides of diverse lengths for SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed seven 
      distinctive mutations that rapidly expanded their intrapopulation frequency and 
      are thought to be candidates of advantageous mutations for the efficient growth 
      in human cells.

AB  - Early establishment of HIV reservoir represents the main impediment to an HIV 
      cure. Mainly composed of infected memory CD4 T-cells and macrophages, HIV 
      reservoirs are found in several organs including lymph nodes, gut, and testes. In 
      men, and as seen in brain and eyes, testes represent a distinctive organ 
      characterized by an immune privilege, allowing the tolerance of spermatozoa which 
      only develop after puberty, long after the establishment of systemic immunity. 
      The immune privilege of testes relies on a strict testis-blood barrier, and a 
      local immunosuppressive environment. Testes has been described as reservoir for 
      several viruses including Ebola, Zika, and HIV. Indeed, HIV reservoirs were 
      detected in tested viremic and virally suppressed donor taking antiretroviral 
      therapy (ART). Herein, we discuss the distinctive environment found in human 
      testes and describe a validated method allowing the characterization and 
      quantification of HIV-infected CD4 T-cells in human testes. Using mechanical and 
      enzymatic treatment, cells can be extracted from human testis samples. 
      Characterization of those cells can be performed by flow cytometry and HIV 
      reservoir quantification performed by nested qPCR after flow cytometry sorting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Persistence of Ebola virus (EBOV) in semen remains of deep concern, 
      as sexual transmission of EBOV seems plausible up to 6 months after acute phase 
      of Ebola virus disease (EVD). Favipiravir, a broad spectrum antiviral product, 
      has been evaluated in reducing EVD mortality in Guinea in 2014-2015 in the JIKI 
      trial, the pharmacokinetic results of which suggest that an increase of dose 
      might be necessary to achieve a therapeutically relevant exposure. In FORCE 
      trial, we aimed at evaluating the tolerance and activity of high doses of 
      favipiravir in male EVD survivors with EBOV RNA detection in semen in Guinea. 
      CASE: In 2016, we launched a phase IIa open-labeled multicenter dose escalation 
      study. Male survivors of EVD with EBOV RT-PCR positive on semen received a 
      loading dose of 2400 mg BID of favipiravir on day 1 then a maintenance dose of 
      1800 mg BID from day 2-14. The primary outcome was the tolerance, assessed daily 
      during period treatment and up to day 90. Unfortunately only two participants 
      were included and the trial was stopped for lack of recruitment. No clinical 
      adverse event of grade 3/4 was reported for both patients. One patient 
      experienced a grade 3 hypocalcemia at day 10 and 14. CONCLUSIONS: High doses of 
      favipiravir were well tolerated in these two participants. Better characterized 
      tolerance and pharmacokinetics of high doses of favipiravir are of utmost 
      importance considering that favipiravir is a candidate treatment for a variety of 
      emerging severe viral diseases with poor prognosis.

      following two independent introductions of cases from the 10th Ebola Outbreak in 
      the Democratic Republic of the Congo, June 2019.

AB  - Uganda established a domestic Viral Hemorrhagic Fever (VHF) testing capacity in 
      2010 in response to the increasing occurrence of filovirus outbreaks. In July 
      2018, the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) experienced its 10th 
      Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak and for the duration of the outbreak, the 
      Ugandan Ministry of Health (MOH) initiated a national EVD preparedness stance. 
      Almost one year later, on 10th June 2019, three family members who had contracted 
      EVD in the DRC crossed into Uganda to seek medical treatment. Samples were 
      collected from all the suspected cases using internationally established 
      biosafety protocols and submitted for VHF diagnostic testing at Uganda Virus 
      Research Institute. All samples were initially tested by RT-PCR for ebolaviruses, 
      marburgviruses, Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever 
      (CCHF) virus. Four people were identified as being positive for Zaire ebolavirus, 
      marking the first report of Zaire ebolavirus in Uganda. In-country Next 
      Generation Sequencing (NGS) and phylogenetic analysis was performed for the first 
      time in Uganda, confirming the outbreak as imported from DRC at two different 
      time point from different clades. This rapid response by the MoH, UVRI and 
      partners led to the control of the outbreak and prevention of secondary virus 
      transmission.

AB  - In this case report, we describe a clinical presentation and therapeutic history 
      of a unique case diagnosed with Lassa fever and severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a 23-year-old man from Yomou prefecture in 
      southeast Guinea identified with suspected Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in the midst 
      of an ongoing outbreak of that disease in the same region. On May 3, 2021, he was 
      admitted to the Nzerekore Epidemic disease treatment center where his clinical 
      condition deteriorated significantly. Laboratory testing performed on the same 
      day reveals a negative EVD polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Three days later, the 
      patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and Lassa fever by reverse 
      transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays. Laboratory examination also indicated severe 
      hematological and biochemical deteriorations in the patient. This case 
      substantiates the need for systematic differential diagnosis during 
      epidemic-prone disease outbreaks to better manage severely unwell patients.

TI  - Nasal carriage of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus among sympatric 
      free-ranging domestic pigs and wild Chlorocebus pygerythrus in a rural African 
      setting.
PG  - 101

AB  - BACKGROUND: Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nasal carriage in 
      domestic pigs and vervet monkeys is a risk factor for subsequent severe 
      infections in domestic pigs and for dissemination to the human population. This 
      study assessed nasal carriage of MRSA in domestic pigs and sympatric vervet 
      monkeys in a rural African village during an outbreak of a virus hemorrhagic 
      fever suspected to be contracted from wild primates. This study was conducted 
      during the 2012 Ebola outbreak to determine nasal carriage of MRSA in 
      free-ranging domestic pigs and sympatric freely roaming vervet monkeys using 
      conventional methods. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) isolated from the 
      anterior nares were tested for susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics and 
      conventional PCR was used to confirm methicillin resistance. The MRSA strains 
      were then genotyped using SCCmec typing. RESULTS: Overall, there was a high level 
      of resistance to tetracycline [90% (63/70) in pigs and 67% (10/15) in vervet 
      monkeys], trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole [90% (63/70) in pigs and 67% (10/15) in 
      vervet monkeys], and penicillin [83% (58/70) in pigs and 67% (10/15) in vervet 
      monkeys]. Most of the MRSA strains (91.6%, 11/12) were of the SCCmec type I [1B] 
      genotype. CONCLUSION: The nasal carriage of drug resistant S. aureus in freely 
      roaming domestic and wild animals presents a risk for widespread environmental 
      spread of antimicrobial resistance thus presenting a risk for treatment failure 
      in domestic animals, wild animals, and humans.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Democratic Republic of the Congo has confronted 13 outbreaks of 
      Ebola virus disease since 1976. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) detecting viral 
      antigens have been developed to circumvent difficulties encountered with RT-PCR 
      for diagnosis in remote low-resource settings, but there is still uncertainty 
      about their performance characteristics and usability during outbreaks. We aimed 
      to assess the field performance of three antigen detection RDTs compared with the 
      gold-standard Cepheid GeneXpert Ebola assay results. METHODS: We conducted a 
      retrospective, multicentre observational study using complete and de-identified 
      databases of five mobile laboratories (managed by the Institut National de 
      Recherche Biomedicale) to assess the performance of three Ebola virus disease 
      RDTs (QuickNavi-Ebola, OraQuick Ebola Rapid Antigen Test, and Coris EBOLA Ag 
      K-SeT rapid test) run on blood samples of patients with suspected Ebola virus 
      disease in direct comparison with the Cepheid GeneXpert Ebola assay reference 
      test during the 2018-20 outbreak in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
      We estimated the sensitivity and specificity of each test through generalised 
      linear mixed models against the GeneXpert Ebola assay reference test and 
      corrected for cycle threshold value and random site effects. FINDINGS: 719 (7.9%) 
      of 9157 samples had a positive GeneXpert Ebola assay result. The QuickNavi-Ebola 
      RDT had a sensitivity of 87.4% (95% CI 63.6-96.8) around the mean cycle threshold 
      value and a specificity of 99.6% (99.3-99.8). The OraQuick Ebola Rapid Antigen 
      Test had a sensitivity of 57.4% (95% CI 38.8-75.8) and specificity of 98.3% 
      (97.5-99.0), and the Coris EBOLA Ag K-SeT rapid test had a sensitivity of 38.9% 
      (23.0-63.6) against the GeneXpert Ebola assay reference and specificity of 97.4% 
      (85.3-99.6). The QuickNavi-Ebola RDT showed a robust performance with good 
      sensitivity, particularly with increasing viral loads (ie, low cycle threshold 
      values), and specificity. INTERPRETATION: The three RDTs evaluated did not 
      achieve the desired sensitivity and specificity of the WHO target product 
      profile. Although the RDTs cannot triage and rule out Ebola virus infection among 
      clinical suspects, they can still help to sort people with suspected Ebola virus 
      disease into high-risk and low-risk groups while waiting for GeneXpert Ebola 
      assay reference testing. FUNDING: None. TRANSLATION: For the French translation

TI  - One-step single-tube accelerated quantitative nucleoprotein gene-specific reverse

      rapid, real-time & reliable clinical detection of Ebola virus.
PG  - 598-606
LID - 10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_864_19 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Due to the absence of specific drugs or vaccines for 
      Ebola virus disease, rapid, sensitive and reliable diagnostic methods are 
      required to control the transmission chain of the disease and for better patient 
      management. Isothermal amplification of nucleic acids has emerged as a promising 
      alternative in which rapid and efficient amplification is achieved at a constant 
      temperature without the thermal cycling required in PCR. METHODS: A one-step 
      single-tube accelerated quantitative reverse trascription loop-mediated 
      isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed by targeting the NP gene 
      of 2014 Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV). The RT-LAMP assay was found to be specific for 
      ZEBOV, without having any cross-reactivity with related haemorrhagic fever viral 
      agents. RESULTS: The comparative evaluation of Ebola virus NP gene-specific 
      RT-LAMP assay with reverse transcription (RT) - PCR and TaqMan real-time RT-PCR 
      demonstrated that RT-LAMP was 10-1000 folds more sensitive than TaqMan real-time 
      RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR, respectively, with a detection limit of 1 copy 
      number. In the absence of real-world clinical samples, the feasibility of Ebola 
      virus RT-LAMP assay for clinical diagnosis was evaluated with different body 
      fluids including serum, urine, saliva, semen and stool samples from healthy human 
      volunteers spiked with gamma-irradiated ZEBOV 2014 obtained from Robert Koch 
      Institute, Berlin, Germany, through the European Network for Diagnostics of 
      Imported Viral Diseases. The Ebola virus RT-LAMP assay could correctly be picked 
      up the spiked samples up to 1 copy of viral RNA without having any matrix 
      interference. The monitoring of gene amplification can also be visualized with 
      the naked eye by using SYBR Green I fluorescent dye. INTERPRETATION & 
      CONCLUSIONS: Thus, due to easy operation without a requirement of sophisticated 
      equipment and skilled personnel, the RT-LAMP assay reported here is a valuable 
      tool as a point-of-care diagnosis for the rapid and real-time detection of Ebola 
      virus in resource-limited healthcare settings of developing countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ebola virus can be transmitted by contact with environmental surfaces 
      (fomites) contaminated with secretions and excretions from infected individuals. 
      Due to their potential to cause a public health emergency and the absence of 
      efficacious drugs and vaccines, a crucial intervention may involve the use of an 
      effective virucidal agent for disinfecting contaminated surfaces. AIM: To 
      evaluate the virucidal efficacy of three disinfectants against Ebola virus: 
      Micro-Chem Plus detergent disinfectant cleaner (MCP), FWD, and ethanol; in 
      suspension tests according to the Technical Standard for Disinfection of China. 
      METHODS: All products at different concentrations were tested with application 
      times ranging from 15 s to 8 min by using a quantitative suspension test, and a 
      comparative inactivation analysis was performed. A reduction in the virus titre 
      of >/=4 log(10) was regarded as evidence of virucidal activity. FINDINGS: MCP and 
      FWD, which contain dual quaternary ammonium compounds, are highly effective at 
      inactivating the Ebola virus within 15 s of contact time, despite a slight 
      difference between them at lower concentrations. In agreement with the 
      literature, our results confirmed the excellent virucidal activity of medical 
      ethanol for Ebola virus, which can reduce viral titres to background levels 
      within 15 s at a concentration of 38% (v/v). CONCLUSION: These three 
      disinfectants display sufficient inactivation efficacy for the Ebola virus at 
      reasonably short contact times, which may be practically achieved in the field. 
      The use of these disinfectants for decontamination in healthcare settings and 
      laboratories could mitigate the risk of Ebola virus transmission.

AB  - In order to detect a predetermined gene in a field test, a facile, visual, and 
      ultrasensitive approach without the need of special and expensive machines is 
      required. In this study, a gene in the Ebola virus was targeted as an example for 
      diagnosis. The key strategy is to incorporate molecular blockers 
      (azobenzene-bearing moieties or thymine dimers) in tandem in one of the PCR 
      primers and stop the polymerase extension there to form a single-stranded 
      overhang. The PCR product was added to the dispersion of gold nanoparticles which 
      were labelled with a probe oligonucleotide. When the Ebola virus-specific gene 
      existed in the specimen, the oligonucleotide on the gold particles formed a 
      double-helix with the single-stranded overhang, and thus the dispersion remained 
      red in color. In the absence of the gene, however, the dispersion rapidly turned 
      to blue because of nanoparticle aggregation. The difference was explicit even 
      when the initial specimen involved only 1 copy of the gene. Accordingly, "whether 
      the patient is infected by the virus or not" can be easily and visually judged by 
      the naked eye.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Viral load in patients with Ebola virus disease affects case fatality 
      rate and is an important parameter used for diagnostic cutoffs, stratification in 
      randomised controlled trials, and epidemiological studies. However, viral load in 
      Ebola virus disease is currently estimated using numerous different assays and 
      protocols that were not developed or validated for this purpose. Here, our aim 
      was to conduct a laboratory-based re-evaluation of the viral loads of a large 
      cohort of Liberian patients with Ebola virus disease and analyse these data in 
      the broader context of the west Africa epidemic. METHODS: In this retrospective 
      observational study, whole blood samples from patients at the Eternal Love 
      Winning Africa Ebola treatment unit (Monrovia, Liberia) were re-extracted with an 
      optimised protocol and analysed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) using a novel 
      semi-strand specific assay to measure viral load. To allow for more direct 
      comparisons, the ddPCR viral loads were also back-calculated to cycle threshold 
      (C(t)) values. The new viral load data were then compared with the C(t) values 
      from the original diagnostic quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) testing to identify 
      differing trends and discrepancies. FINDINGS: Between Aug 28 and Dec 18, 2014, 
      727 whole blood samples from 528 individuals were collected. 463 (64%) were 
      first-draw samples and 409 (56%) were from patients positive for Ebola virus 
      (EBOV), species Zaire ebolavirus. Of the 307 first-draw EBOV-positive samples, 
      127 (41%) were from survivors and 180 (59%) were from non-survivors; 155 (50%) 
      were women, 145 (47%) were men, and seven (2%) were not recorded, and the mean 
      age was 29.3 (SD 15.0) years for women and 31.8 (SD 14.8) years for men. 
      Survivors had significantly lower mean viral loads at presentation than 
      non-survivors in both the reanalysed dataset (5.61 [95% CI 5.34-5.87] vs 7.19 
      [6.99-7.38] log(10) EBOV RNA copies per mL; p<0.0001) and diagnostic dataset 
      (C(t) value 28.72 [27.97-29.47] vs 26.26 [25.72-26.81]; p<0.0001). However, the 
      prognostic capacity of viral load increased with the reanalysed dataset (odds 
      ratio [OR] of death 8.06 [95% CI 4.81-13.53], p<0.0001 for viral loads above 6.71 
      log(10) EBOV RNA copies per mL vs OR of death 2.02 [1.27-3.20], p=0.0028 for C(t) 
      values below 27.37). Diagnostic qRT-PCR significantly (p<0.0001) underestimated 
      viral load in both survivors and non-survivors (difference in diagnostic C(t) 
      value minus laboratory C(t) value of 1.79 [95% CI 1.16-2.43] for survivors and 
      5.15 [4.43-5.87] for non-survivors). Six samples that were reported negative by 
      diagnostic testing were found to be positive upon reanalysis and had high viral 
      loads. INTERPRETATION: Inaccurate viral load estimation from diagnostic C(t) 
      values is probably multifactorial; however, unaddressed PCR inhibition from 
      tissue damage in patients with fulminant Ebola virus disease could largely 
      account for the discrepancies observed in our study. Testing protocols for Ebola 
      virus disease require further standardisation and validation to produce accurate 
      viral load estimates, minimise false negatives, and allow for reliable 
      epidemiological investigation. FUNDING: Intramural Research Program of the

TI  - Risk Factors for Ebola Virus Persistence in Semen of Survivors in Liberia.
PG  - e849-e856
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac424 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term persistence of Ebola virus (EBOV) in immunologically 
      privileged sites has been implicated in recent outbreaks of Ebola virus disease 
      (EVD) in Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo. This study was designed to 
      understand how the acute course of EVD, convalescence, and host immune and 
      genetic factors may play a role in prolonged viral persistence in semen. METHODS: 
      A cohort of 131 male EVD survivors in Liberia were enrolled in a case-case study. 
      "Early clearers" were defined as those with 2 consecutive negative EBOV semen 
      test results by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction 
      (rRT-PCR) >/=2 weeks apart within 1 year after discharge from the Ebola treatment 
      unit or acute EVD. "Late clearers" had detectable EBOV RNA by rRT-PCR >1 year 
      after discharge from the Ebola treatment unit or acute EVD. Retrospective 
      histories of their EVD clinical course were collected by questionnaire, followed 
      by complete physical examinations and blood work. RESULTS: Compared with early 
      clearers, late clearers were older (median, 42.5 years; P < .001) and experienced 
      fewer severe clinical symptoms (median 2, P = .006). Late clearers had more lens 
      opacifications (odds ratio, 3.9 [95% confidence interval, 1.1-13.3]; P = .03), 
      after accounting for age, higher total serum immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3) titers (P = 
      .005), and increased expression of the HLA-C*03:04 allele (0.14 [.02-.70]; P = 
      .007). CONCLUSIONS: Older age, decreased illness severity, elevated total serum 
      IgG3 and HLA-C*03:04 allele expression may be risk factors for the persistence of 
      EBOV in the semen of EVD survivors. EBOV persistence in semen may also be 
      associated with its persistence in other immunologically protected sites, such as 
      the eye.

AB  - Antigen-combining sites of the camelid heavy-chain antibody variable domain (VHH) 
      are constructed by three complementarity-determining regions (CDR1, CDR2 and 
      CDR3). We prepared cDNA using mRNA extracted from peripheral lymphocytes of 
      alpacas that had been non-immunized or immunized with human serum albumin (HSA). 
      The VHH gene fragments encoding the amino-terminal half-containing CDR1 as well 
      as CDR2 and the carboxy-terminal half-containing CDR3 were amplified 
      independently by PCR, and then full-length VHH gene fragments were generated by 
      overlap extension PCR and cloned into the phagemid vector. This protocol, 
      referred to as CDR shuffling, allowed us to construct an alpaca VHH phage display 
      library possessing repertoires different from those naturally occurring in 
      animals. We asked, first, whether this library was able to provide the functional 
      VHH fragments against HSA, an immunized antigen, and obtained 29 anti-HSA VHH 
      clones, 41% possessed KD values of lower than 10-8 M, 5 of which had KD values of 
      10-10 M. We also obtained VHH clones against non-immunized protein antigens such 
      as cardiac troponin T and I, Ebola virus glycoprotein 1 and human immunoglobulin 
      G by biopanning. We compared the amino acid sequences and affinities and found 
      that 43% of VHHs had KD values of less than 10-8 M, although those having KD 
      values of 10-10 M were unavailable. These results suggested that the CDR-shuffled 
      VHH phage display library could potentially provide VHHs against non-immunized 
      protein antigens with similar levels of affinities to those against immunized 
      antigens.

TI  - Rapid diagnostic tests versus RT-PCR for Ebola virus infections: a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 447-458
LID - 10.2471/BLT.21.287496 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical accuracy of rapid diagnostic tests for the 
      detection of Ebola virus. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE(R), Embase(R) and Web of 
      Science for articles published between 1976 and October 2021 reporting on 
      clinical studies assessing the performance of Ebola virus rapid diagnostic tests 
      compared with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We 
      assessed study quality using the QUADAS-2 criteria. To estimate the pooled 
      sensitivity and specificity of these rapid diagnostic tests, we used a bivariate 
      random-effects meta-analysis. FINDINGS: Our search identified 113 unique studies, 
      of which nine met the inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in the 
      Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and they 
      evaluated 12 rapid diagnostic tests. We included eight studies in the 
      meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the rapid tests were 86% 
      (95% confidence interval, CI: 80-91) and 95% (95% CI: 91-97), respectively. 
      However, pooled sensitivity decreased to 83% (95% CI: 77-88) after removing 
      outliers. Pooled sensitivity increased to 90% (95% CI: 82-94) when analysis was 
      restricted to studies using the RT-PCR from altona Diagnostics as gold standard. 
      Pooled sensitivity increased to 99% (95% CI: 67-100) when the analysis was 
      restricted to studies using whole or capillary blood specimens. CONCLUSION: The 
      included rapid diagnostic tests did not detect all the Ebola virus disease cases. 
      While the sensitivity and specificity of these tests are moderate, they are still 
      valuable tools, especially useful for triage and detecting Ebola virus in remote 
      areas.

TI  - Exotic viral hepatitis: A review on epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment.

AB  - Certain "exotic" viruses are known to cause clinical diseases with potential 
      liver involvement. These include viruses, beyond regular hepatotropic viruses 
      (hepatitis A, -B(D), -C, -E, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus), that can be 
      found in (sub)tropical areas and can cause "exotic viral hepatitis". Transmission 
      routes typically involve arthropods (Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, dengue, 
      Rift Valley fever, yellow fever). However, some of these viruses are transmitted 
      by the aerosolised excreta of rodents (Hantavirus, Lassa fever), or via direct 
      contact or contact with bodily fluids (Ebola). Although some exotic viruses are 
      associated with high fatality rates, such as Ebola for example, the clinical 
      presentation of most exotic viruses can range from mild flu-like symptoms, in 
      most cases, right through to being potentially fatal. A smaller percentage of 
      people develop severe disease with haemorrhagic fever, possibly with (fulminant) 
      hepatitis. Liver involvement is often caused by direct tropism for hepatocytes 
      and Kupffer cells, resulting in virus-mediated and/or immune-mediated necrosis. 
      In all exotic hepatitis viruses, PCR is the most sensitive diagnostic method. The 
      determination of IgM/IgG antibodies is a reasonable alternative, but 
      cross-reactivity can be a problem in the case of flaviviruses. Licenced vaccines 
      are available for yellow fever and Ebola, and they are currently under 
      development for dengue. Therapy for exotic viral hepatitis is predominantly 
      supportive. To ensure that preventive measures can be introduced to control 
      possible outbreaks, the timely detection of these viruses is very important.

LID - 2047
AB  - Our primary objectives were (a) to determine the need for and the availability of 
      point-of-care testing (POCT) for infectious diseases and (b) to recommend 
      point-of-care testing strategies and Spatial Care Paths(TM) (SCPs) that enhance 
      public health preparedness in the regional districts of Thua Thien Hue Province 
      (TTHP), Central Vietnam, where we conducted field surveys. Medical professionals 
      in seven community health centers (CHCs), seven district hospitals (DHs) and one 
      provincial hospital (PH) participated. Survey questions (English and Vietnamese) 
      determined the status of diagnostic testing capabilities for infectious diseases 
      and other acute medical challenges in TTHP. Infectious disease testing was 
      limited: six of seven CHCs (86%) lacked infectious disease tests. One CHC (14%, 
      1/7) had two forms of diagnostic tests available for the detection of malaria. 
      All CHCs lacked adequate microbiology laboratories. District hospitals had few 
      diagnostic tests for infectious diseases (tuberculosis and syphilis), blood 
      culture (29%, 2/7), and pathogen culture (57%, 4/7) available. The PH had broader 
      diagnostic testing capabilities but lacked preparedness for highly infectious 
      disease threats (e.g., Ebola, MERS-CoV, SARS, Zika, and monkeypox). All sites 
      reported having COVID-19 rapid antigen tests; COVID-19 RT-PCR tests were limited 
      to higher-tier hospitals. We conclude that infectious disease diagnostic testing 
      should be improved and POC tests must be supplied near patients' homes and in 
      primary care settings for the early detection of infected individuals and the 
      mitigation of the spread of new COVID-19 variants and other highly infectious 
      diseases.

TI  - Providing On-Site Laboratory and Biosafety Just-In-Time Training Inside a 
      Box-Based Laboratory during the West Africa Ebola Outbreak: Supporting Better 
      Preparedness for Future Health Emergencies.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph191811566 [doi]
LID - 11566
AB  - The Biological Light Fieldable Laboratory for Emergencies (B-LiFE) is a box-based 
      modular laboratory with the capacity to quickly deploy on-site in cases of 
      uncontrolled spread of infectious disease. During the 2014-2015 West Africa Ebola 
      outbreak, this tent laboratory provided diagnostic support to the N'Zerekore 
      Ebola Treatment Center (ETC), Guinea, for three months. One of the objectives of 
      B-LiFE deployment was to contribute, as much as possible, to national capacity 
      building by training local scientists. Two Guinean biologists were selected 
      according to their basic biological knowledge and laboratory skills among 50 
      candidate trainees, and were integrated into the team through "just-in-time 
      training" (JiTT), which helped the biologists acquire knowledge and laboratory 
      skills beyond their expertise. The JiTT program was conducted according to 
      standard laboratory procedures, in line with international biosafety guidelines 
      adapted to field conditions. Supervised acquisition of field-laboratory practices 
      mainly focused on biochemical testing and Ebola viral load quantification using 
      routine PCR-based detection, including the Biofire FilmArray((R)) system (BFA), a 
      novel, as yet non-validated, automated assay for diagnostic testing of Ebola 
      virus disease at the time of B-LiFE deployment. During the JiTT, the two 
      biologists were closely involved in all laboratory activities, including BFA 
      validation and biosafety procedures. Meanwhile, this successful JiTT enhanced the 
      B-LiFE in-field operational capacity and contributed to national capacity 
      building. A post-training evaluation and contacts were organised to assess the 
      evolution and technical skills gained by the two researchers during the B-LiFE 
      mission. At the end of the B-LiFE mission, both biologists were enrolled in 
      follow-on programmes to curb the epidemic spreading in Africa. These results 
      demonstrate that during infectious disease outbreaks or major crises, the JiTT 
      approach can rapidly expand access to critical diagnostic testing and train local 
      staff to do so.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a dangerous condition that can cause an 
      epidemic. Several rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been developed to diagnose 
      EVD. These RDTs promise to be quicker and easier to use than the current 
      reference standard diagnostic test, PCR. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic 
      accuracy of RDTs for EVD. METHODS: A systematic review of diagnostic accuracy 
      studies. DATA SOURCES: The following bibliographic databases were searched from 
      inception to present: MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, Global Health, Cochrane Central 
      Register of Controlled Trials, WHO Global Index Medicus database, Web of Science, 
      PROSPERO register of Systematic Reviews, and Clinical Trials.Gov. STUDY 
      ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Diagnostic accuracy studies. PARTICIPANTS: Patients 
      presenting to the Ebola treatment units with symptoms of EVD. INTERVENTIONS: 
      RDTs; reference standard, RT-PCR. ASSESSMENT OF RISK OF BIAS: Quality Assessment 
      of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. METHODS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Summary 
      estimates of diagnostic accuracy study were produced for each device type. 
      Subgroup analyses were performed for RDT type and specimen material. A 
      sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of trial design and bias. 
      RESULTS: We included 15 diagnostic accuracy studies. The summary estimate of 
      sensitivity for lateral flow assays was 86.1% (95% CI, 86-86.2%), with 
      specificity of 97% (95% CI, 96.1-97.9%). The summary estimate for rapid PCR 
      devices was sensitivity of 96.2% (95% CI, 95.3-97.9%), with a specificity of 
      96.8% (95% CI, 95.3-97.9%). Pre-specified subgroup analyses demonstrated that 
      RDTs were effective on a range of specimen material. Overall, the risk of bias 
      throughout the included studies was low, but it was high in patient selection and 
      uncertain in the flow and timing domains. CONCLUSIONS: RDTs possess both high 
      sensitivity and specificity compared with RT-PCR among symptomatic patients 
      presenting to the Ebola treatment units. Our findings support the use of RDTs as 
      a 'rule in' test to expedite treatment and vaccination.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) causes high case fatality rates (CFRs) in 
      young children, yet there are limited data focusing on predicting mortality in 
      pediatric patients. Here we present machine learning-derived prognostic models to 
      predict clinical outcomes in children infected with Ebola virus. METHODS: Using 
      retrospective data from the Ebola Data Platform, we investigated children with 
      EVD from the West African EVD outbreak in 2014-2016. Elastic net regularization 
      was used to create a prognostic model for EVD mortality. In addition to external 
      validation with data from the 2018-2020 EVD epidemic in the Democratic Republic 
      of the Congo (DRC), we updated the model using selected serum biomarkers. 
      FINDINGS: Pediatric EVD mortality was significantly associated with younger age, 
      lower PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values, unexplained bleeding, respiratory 
      distress, bone/muscle pain, anorexia, dysphagia, and diarrhea. These variables 
      were combined to develop the newly described EVD Prognosis in Children (EPiC) 
      predictive model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
      (AUC) for EPiC was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.74-0.81) in the West Africa derivation dataset 
      and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.88) in the DRC validation dataset. Updating the model 
      with peak aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or creatinine kinase (CK) measured 
      within the first 48 hours after admission increased the AUC to 0.90 (0.77-1.00) 
      and 0.87 (0.74-1.00), respectively. CONCLUSION: The novel EPiC prognostic model 
      that incorporates clinical information and commonly used biochemical tests, such 
      as AST and CK, can be used to predict mortality in children with EVD.

LID - 14105
AB  - The recent health crises (e.g., COVID-19, Ebola and Monkeypox) have pointed out 
      huge disparities in vaccine accessibility across the world. Nonetheless, certain 
      governments have instituted vaccine passport policies (VPPs) to manage public 
      health, raising mixed concerns from the public. Focusing on COVID-19 outbreak as 
      an example, this review and commentary article utilises an institutional theory 
      perspective to uncover the factors contributing to the global vaccine divide. We 
      also explore the wider impact of VPPs to determine whether such tools promote 
      freedom or social exclusion. Our insights shed light on a controversial and 
      increasingly divisive policy with an international dimension and institutional 
      implications. For instance, while some argue that VPPs may be relatively better 
      than the blunt instrument of lockdowns, VPPs also implicate access and 
      discrimination concerns. Given the various reasons for global vaccine 
      disparities, a hybrid policy that combines vaccine passports with other public 
      health practices (e.g., rapid lateral flow/affordable polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) tests and good hygiene) may be more viable. Furthermore, while VPPs may not 
      be desirable and acceptable domestically, they may be inevitable for 
      international travel.

AB  - We explore how animal host traits, phylogenetic identity and cell receptor 
      sequences relate to infection status and mortality from ebolaviruses. We gathered 
      exhaustive databases of mortality from Ebolavirus after exposure and infection 
      status based on PCR and antibody tests. We performed ridge regressions predicting 
      mortality and infection as a function of traits, phylogenetic eigenvectors and 
      separately host receptor sequences. We found that mortality from Ebolavirus had a 
      strong association to life history characteristics and phylogeny. In contrast, 
      infection status related not just to life history and phylogeny, but also to 
      fruit consumption which suggests that geographic overlap of frugivorous mammals 
      can lead to spread of virus in the wild. Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) receptor 
      sequences predicted infection statuses of bats included in our study with very 
      high accuracy, suggesting that characterizing NPC1 in additional species is a 
      promising avenue for future work. We combine the predictions from our mortality 
      and infection status models to differentiate between species that are infected 
      and also die from Ebolavirus versus species that are infected but tolerate the 
      virus (possible reservoirs of Ebolavirus). We therefore present the first 
      comprehensive estimates of Ebolavirus reservoir statuses for all known 
      terrestrial mammals in Africa.

      Ebola Outbreak in Sierra Leone.
PG  - 119-132

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical management of persistent medical conditions affecting 
      Ebola survivors, generally described as a post-Ebola syndrome, remains a public 
      health concern. We aimed to analyze Ebola survivors' laboratory biomarkers as 
      compared to their non-infected household relatives to identify biomarkers that 
      could guide the identification of survivors at increased risk of developing 
      severe at odds with the non-severe post-Ebola syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Data were extracted from medical records of the Ebola survivors clinic, and we 
      included only Ebola survivor's parameters recorded during the first baseline 
      follow-up visit 2 weeks interval after their second negative PCR result. 
      Moreover, household non-infected family contacts of survivors visiting the clinic 
      during the same period were recruited as community control. RESULTS: The mean age 
      of survivors was 32.65 (IQR: 15.5, 38.25) years, and Ebola IgG immunoglobulin was 
      detected in all, thus confirming their status. The statistical significance (all 
      p < 0.05) observed in monocyte percentage (MONO%), cluster of differentiation 4 
      percentage (CD4%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine (CREA), and 
      creatinine kinase (C-kinase) proved to be clinically significant as compared to 
      the household relatives' group. Interestingly, the linear regression analysis 
      indicated that the duration at ETU was negatively associated with lymphocyte 
      percentage with a 5% lymphocyte decrease per day spent at ETU. Finally, there was 
      a significant (p < 0.05) association between hematological (Hb, PCV, MCV, MCH), 
      biochemical (ALT, CREA, C-kinase, T-cholesterol, triglycerides) parameters and 
      the risk of developing severe complications. CONCLUSION: We recommend clinicians 
      closely monitor Hb, PCV, MCV, MCH, ALT, CREA, C-kinase, T-cholesterol, 
      triglycerides and lymphocytes as clinically relevant laboratory biomarkers to 
      identify survivors at higher risk of developing severe post-acute syndrome upon 
      discharge from Ebola treatment unit including headache, abdominal pain, chest 
      pain, ocular complication, arthralgia, hearing difficulty and erectile 
      dysfunction which can impact health-related quality of life among Ebola 
      survivors.

AB  - Recently, infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, monkeypox, and Ebola, are 
      plaguing human beings. Rapid and accurate diagnosis methods are required to 
      preclude the spread of diseases. In this paper, an ultrafast polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) equipment is designed to detect virus. The equipment consists of a 
      silicon-based PCR chip, a thermocycling module, an optical detection module, and 
      a control module. Silicon-based chip, with its thermal and fluid design, is used 
      to improve detection efficiency. A thermoelectric cooler (TEC), together with a 
      computer-controlled proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, is applied 
      to accelerate the thermal cycle. A maximum of four samples can be tested 
      simultaneously on the chip. Two kinds of fluorescent molecules can be detected by 
      optical detection module. The equipment can detect viruses with 40 PCR 
      amplification cycles in 5 min. The equipment is portable, easily operated, and 
      low equipment cost, which shows great potential in epidemic prevention.

TI  - Using Multiplex Amplicon PCR Technology to Efficiently and Timely Generate Rift 
      Valley Fever Virus Sequence Data for Genomic Surveillance.
LID - 10.3390/v15020477 [doi]
LID - 477
AB  - Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a febrile vector-borne disease endemic in Africa and 
      continues to spread in new territories. It is a climate-sensitive disease mostly 
      triggered by abnormal rainfall patterns. The disease is associated with high 
      mortality and morbidity in both humans and livestock. RVF is caused by the Rift 
      Valley fever virus (RVFV) of the genus Phlebovirus in the family Phenuiviridae. 
      It is a tripartite RNA virus with three genomic segments: small (S), medium (M) 
      and large (L). Pathogen genomic sequencing is becoming a routine procedure and a 
      powerful tool for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of infectious 
      organisms, including viruses. Inspired by the utility of amplicon-based 
      sequencing demonstrated in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) and Ebola, Zika and West Nile viruses, we report an RVFV sample 
      preparation based on amplicon multiplex polymerase chain reaction (amPCR) for 
      template enrichment and reduction of background host contamination. The 
      technology can be implemented rapidly to characterize and genotype RVFV during 
      outbreaks in a near-real-time manner. To achieve this, we designed 74 multiplex 
      primer sets covering the entire RVFV genome to specifically amplify the nucleic 
      acid of RVFV in clinical samples from an animal tissue. Using this approach, we 
      demonstrate achieving complete RVFV genome coverage even from samples containing 
      a relatively low viral load. We report the first primer scheme approach of 
      generating multiplex primer sets for a tripartite virus which can be replicated 
      for other segmented viruses.

AB  - Underserved, low-income, rural and certain migrant populations have greater risks 
      and higher incidences of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) than more privileged 
      populations. Current in-person testing methods have limitations, namely exposure 
      risk, a requirement of accessible transportation to healthcare facilities, and 
      economic barriers. Dried blood spots (DBS) samples are widely used for 
      diagnostics in many infectious diseases including Rabies, HIV, Ebola viruses and 
      newborn screening. Our goal was to determine the accuracy and reliability of 
      measuring COVID-19 IgG in DBS compared to paired plasma samples in a population 
      with known infection status and then apply this method to screen an underserved 
      minority population with high risk for COVID-9 infection (unvaccinated, pregnant, 
      low income, Hispanic women). To optimize the assay, we tested 22 nonpregnant 
      women, 12 with positive prior PCR testing for SARS-CoV2 infection and 10 with 
      negative PCR results. After the assay was optimized, we tested the assay in a 
      vulnerable population with a high risk for infection, who were 52 Hispanic 
      pregnant women without prior PCR testing or vaccination. DBS assay results in 
      both groups showed an agreement of 100% with paired plasma samples. The 
      availability of a DBS assay could enable people who may not have access or 
      transportation to healthcare facilities to use DBS as a COVID-19 testing vehicle.

TI  - Head-to-head comparison of diagnostic accuracy of four Ebola virus disease rapid

      outbreaks: a prospective observational study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks have emerged in Central and West 
      Africa. EVD diagnosis relies principally on RT-PCR testing with GeneXpert(R), which 
      has logistical and cost restrictions at the peripheral level of the health 
      system. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) would offer a valuable alternative at the 
      point-of-care to reduce the turn-around time, if they show good performance 
      characteristics. We evaluated the performance of four EVD RDTs against the 
      reference standard GeneXpert(R) on stored EVD positive and negative blood samples 
      collected between 2018 and 2021 from outbreaks in eastern Democratic Republic of 
      the Congo (DRC). METHODS: We conducted a prospective and observational study in 
      the laboratory on QuickNavi-Ebola, OraQuick(R) Ebola Rapid Antigen, Coris(R) EBOLA 
      Ag K-SeT, and Standard(R) Q Ebola Zaire Ag RDTs using left-over archived frozen 
      EDTA whole blood samples. We randomly selected 450 positive and 450 negative 
      samples from the EVD biorepositories in DRC, across a range of GeneXpert(R) cycle 
      threshold values (Ct-values). RDT results were read by three persons and we 
      considered an RDT result as "positive", when it was flagged as positive by at 
      least two out of the three readers. We estimated the sensitivity and specificity 
      through two independent generalized (logistic) linear mixed models (GLMM). 
      FINDINGS: 476 (53%) of 900 samples had a positive GeneXpert Ebola result when 
      retested. The QuickNavi-Ebola showed a sensitivity of 56.8% (95% CI 53.6-60.0) 
      and a specificity of 97.5% (95% CI 96.2-98.4), the OraQuick(R) Ebola Rapid Antigen 
      test displayed 61.6% (95% CI 57.0-65.9) sensitivity and 98.1% (95% CI 96.2-99.1) 
      specificity, the Coris(R) EBOLA Ag K-SeT showed 25.0% (95% CI 22.3-27.9) 
      sensitivity and 95.9% (95% CI 94.2-97.1) specificity, and the Standard(R) Q Ebola 
      Zaire Ag displayed 21.6% (95% CI 18.1-25.7) sensitivity and 99.1% (95% CI 
      97.4-99.7) specificity. INTERPRETATION: None of the RDTs evaluated approached the 
      "desired or acceptable levels" for sensitivity set out in the WHO target product 
      profile, while all of the tests met the "desired level" for specificity. 
      Nevertheless, the QuickNavi-Ebola and OraQuick(R) Ebola Rapid Antigen Test 
      demonstrated the most favorable profiles, and may be used as frontline tests for 
      triage of suspected-cases while waiting for RT-qPCR confirmatory testing.

AB  - Recent studies have indicated that bats are hosts to diverse filoviruses. 
      Currently, no pan-filovirus molecular assays are available that have been 
      evaluated for the detection of all mammalian filoviruses. In this study, a 
      two-step pan-filovirus SYBR Green real-time PCR assay targeting the nucleoprotein 
      gene was developed for filovirus surveillance in bats. Synthetic constructs were 
      designed as representatives of nine filovirus species and used to evaluate the 
      assay. This assay detected all synthetic constructs included with an analytical 
      sensitivity of 3-31.7 copies/reaction and was evaluated against the field 
      collected samples. The assay's performance was similar to a previously published 
      probe based assay for detecting Ebola- and Marburgvirus. The developed 
      pan-filovirus SYBR Green assay will allow for more affordable and sensitive 
      detection of mammalian filoviruses in bat samples.

AB  - Non-human primate (NHP)-based model systems faithfully reproduce various viral 
      diseases including Ebola, influenza, AIDS and Zika. However, only a small number 
      of NHP cell lines are available and generation of additional cell lines could 
      help to refine these models. We immortalized rhesus macaque kidney cells by 
      lentiviral transduction with a vector encoding telomerase reverse transcriptase 
      (TERT) and report the generation of three TERT-immortalized cell lines derived 
      from rhesus macaque kidney. Expression of the kidney podocyte marker podoplanin 
      on these cells was demonstrated by flow cytometry. Quantitative real-time PCR 
      (qRT-PCR) was employed to demonstrate induction of MX1 expression upon 
      stimulation with interferon (IFN) or viral infection, suggesting a functional IFN 
      system. Further, the cell lines were susceptible to entry driven by the 
      glycoproteins of vesicular stomatitis virus, influenza A virus, Ebola virus, 
      Nipah virus and Lassa virus as assessed by infection with retroviral pseudotypes. 
      Finally, these cells supported growth of Zika virus and the primate 
      simplexviruses Cercopithecine alphaherpesvirus 2 and Papiine alphaherpesvirus 2. 
      In summary, we developed IFN-responsive rhesus macaque kidney cell lines that 
      allowed entry driven by diverse viral glycoproteins and were permissive to 
      infection with Zika virus and primate simplexviruses. These cell lines will be 
      useful for efforts to analyze viral infections of the kidney in macaque models.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Minimal data exist on pregnancy following recovery from Ebola in 
      people of child-bearing potential (females aged roughly 18-45 years). The aim of 
      this study was to assess viral persistence or reactivation in pregnancy, the 
      frequency of placental transfer of anti-Ebola IgG antibodies, and pregnancy 
      outcomes in this population. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, we 
      studied self-reported pregnancies in two groups: seropositive people who had 
      recovered from Ebola virus disease (seropositive group) and seronegative people 
      who had close contact with people with Ebola (seronegative group). Participants 
      had enrolled in the PREVAIL III longitudinal study and were exposed during the 
      2014-2016 Liberian Ebola outbreak. The primary outcome was pregnancy result. We 
      assessed rates of livebirths and other pregnancy results in both study groups, 
      and presence of Ebola RNA by PCR in samples of placenta, maternal and cord blood, 
      breastmilk, and vaginal secretions from people who had recovered from Ebola who 
      conceived a median of 14 months after acute Ebola virus disease. Mixed-model 
      logistic regression evaluated associations between first-reported pregnancy 
      outcome, age, and study group. Growth and neurodevelopment in the infants born to 
      people in the seropositive group were assessed at 6-month intervals for 2 years. 
      Data were accrued by PREVAIL III study staff. FINDINGS: 1566 participants were 
      enrolled between June 17, 2015, and Dec 14, 2017, of whom 639 became pregnant 
      (215 seropositive, 424 seronegative) and 589 reported pregnancy outcomes (206 
      seropositive, 383 seronegative). 105 infants born to 98 mothers in the 
      seropositive group were enrolled in the birth cohort. Ebola RNA was not detected 
      in 205 samples of placenta, cord blood, or maternal blood taken at birth from 54 
      mothers in the seropositive group, nor in 367 vaginal swabs. Viral RNA was found 
      in two of 354 longitudinal breastmilk samples. All but one of 57 infants born 
      during these 54 births were seropositive for anti-Ebola antibodies. Neonates 
      showed high concentrations of anti-Ebola IgG, which declined after 6 months. Odds 
      of adverse pregnancy outcome among the two groups were indistinguishable (OR 
      1.13, 95% CI 0.71-1.79). Compared with WHO standards, infants born to those in 
      the seropositive group had lower median weight and length, and larger median head 
      circumference over 2 years. Compared with a cohort from the USA accrual of gross 
      motor developmental milestones was similar, whereas attainment of pincer grasp 
      and early vocalisation were mildly delayed. INTERPRETATION: The risks of Ebola 
      virus reactivation in the peripartum and postpartum period and of adverse birth 
      outcomes are low in those who have recovered from Ebola virus disease and become 
      pregnant approximately 1 year after acute Ebola virus disease. The implication 
      for clinical practice is that care of people who are pregnant and who have 
      recovered from Ebola can be offered without risks to health-care providers or 
      stigmatisation of the mothers and their offspring. The implication for 
      prospective mothers is that safe pregnancies are entirely possible after recovery 
      from Ebola. FUNDING: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and

AB  - Bat-borne emerging zoonotic viruses cause major outbreaks, such as the Ebola 
      virus, Nipah virus, and/or beta coronavirus. Pteropine orthoreovirus (PRV), whose 
      spillover event occurred from fruits bats to humans, causes respiratory syndrome 
      in humans widely in South East Asia. Repurposing approved drugs against PRV is an 
      effective tool to confront future PRV pandemics. We screened 2,943 compounds in 
      an FDA-approved drug library and identified eight hit compounds that reduce viral 
      cytopathic effects on cultured Vero cells. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis 
      revealed that six of eight hit compounds significantly inhibited PRV replication. 
      Among them, micafungin used clinically as an antifungal drug, displayed a 
      prominent antiviral effect on PRV. Secondly, the antiviral effects of micafungin 
      on PRV infected human cell lines (HEK293T and A549), and their transcriptome 
      changes by PRV infection were investigated, compared to four different 
      bat-derived cell lines (FBKT1 (Ryukyu flying fox), DEMKT1 (Leschenault's 
      rousette), BKT1 (Greater horseshoe bat), YUBFKT1 (Eastern bent-wing bats)). In 
      two human cell lines, unlike bat cells that induce an IFN-gamma response pathway, an 
      endoplasmic reticulum stress response pathway was commonly activated. 
      Additionally, micafungin inhibits viral release rather than suppressing PRV 
      genome replication in human cells, although it was disturbed in Vero cells. The 
      target of micafungin's action may vary depending on the animal species, but it 
      must be useful for human purposes as a first choice of medical care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiplex real-time PCR is a quick and cost effective method for 
      detection of various gene simultaneously. HFSV (Hemorrhagic Fever Syndrome Virus) 
      is a newly emerging infectious disease because of globalization and climate 
      change. We tried to develop a molecular diagnostic technique for various 
      causative viruses and evaluate its usefulness for improving public health. 
      METHODS: Molecular diagnostic test method that qualitatively detects viruses 
      causing viral hemorrhagic fevers hired Taq-Man Real-time RT-PCR technique. The Ct 
      value was experimentally observed three or more times at the RNA concentration 
      before and after the detection limit. After designing a multiplex real-time 
      RT-PCR test for target gene of selected 17 viruses, the detection limit for each 
      target and the presence or absence of cross-reaction and interference reaction 
      were evaluated to determine its availability. RESULTS: Six kinds of viruses, 
      including Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, 
      Sabia virus, Chapare virus, Yellow fever virus, and Variola virus (A4L gene, B12R 
      gene), were able to confirm the detection limit of 0.5 copies/mul, and other Ebola 
      virus, Marburg virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Kyasanur Forest disease virus, 
      Junin virus, Guanarito virus, Machupo virus, Chikungunya virus, Hantavirus, 
      Dengue virus types 1-4, and Lassa virus (L gene, GPC gene), and 11 kinds of 
      viruses, the detection limit was confirmed at 5 copies/mul. No cross-reaction or 
      interference between detected genes was observed. CONCLUSION: The virus test 
      method developed through this study using multiplex is expected to be used for 
      public health and quarantine as a test method that can be used when a hemorrhagic 
      fever virus of unknown cause is introduced.

AB  - Rapid pathogen identification is a critical first step in patient isolation, 
      treatment, and controlling an outbreak. Real-time PCR is a highly sensitive and 
      specific approach commonly used for infectious disease diagnostics. However, 
      mismatches in the primer or probe sequence and the target organism can cause 
      decreased sensitivity, assay failure, and false negative results. Limited genomic 
      sequences for rare pathogens such as Ebola virus (EBOV) can negatively impact 
      assay performance due to undiscovered genetic diversity. We previously developed 
      and validated several EBOV assays prior to the 2013-2016 EBOV outbreak in West 
      Africa, and sequencing EBOV Makona identified sequence variants that could impact 
      assay performance. Here, we assessed the impact sequence mismatches have on EBOV 
      assay performance, finding one or two primer or probe mismatches resulted in a 
      range of impact from minimal to almost two log sensitivity reduction. Redesigning 
      this assay improved detection of all EBOV variants tested. Comparing the 
      performance of the new assay with the previous assays across a panel of human 
      EBOV samples confirmed increased assay sensitivity as reflected in decreased Cq 
      values with detection of three positive that tested negative with the original 
      assay.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: after a year of evolution, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a 
      burden. The African continent has not had the high case and death rates from 
      COVID-19 as was predicted early in the pandemic. However, coronavirus is placing 
      severe strains on Africa s health and economic sectors. Senegal, like other 
      African countries, continues to face this pandemic. The purpose of this study is 
      to evaluate the management strategy and the epidemiological profile of the 
      pandemic in Senegal one year on. METHODS: we listed all patients who tested 
      positive for COVID-19 by RT-PCR throughout the country during the first year of 
      the pandemic, from 2 March 2020 (first case date) to 1(st) March 2021. 
      Epidemiological data were analysed. RESULTS: a total of 34,732 positive cases 
      were diagnosed and recorded in one year, with a case-fatality rate of 2.5%. All 
      the country s administrative regions had been affected. Dakar, the capital, was 
      the epicentre of the pandemic. Male predominance was established on the basis of 
      the number of positive cases and deaths. The average age of subjects was 47 years 
      and the cure rate was 83.5%. People over 60 were the most vulnerable, 
      particularly those with cardiovascular co-morbidities. CONCLUSION: Senegal s 
      strategy for managing COVID-19 has received international recognition. It has 
      been dynamic, drawing on experience from previous management of public health 
      events such as Ebola. The COVID-19 pandemic has put a strain on our fragile 
      health systems. However, the response and the results achieved highlight the 
      significant progress made by our country, helping to ensure the resilience of the 
      health system.

TI  - Immunogenicity and Vaccine Shedding After 1 or 2 Doses of rVSVDeltaG-ZEBOV-GP Ebola 
      Vaccine (ERVEBO(R)): Results From a Phase 2, Randomized, Placebo-controlled Trial 
      in Children and Adults.
PG  - 870-879
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciad693 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rVSVDeltaG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine (ERVEBO(R)) is a single-dose, 
      live-attenuated, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine indicated for the 
      prevention of Ebola virus disease (EVD) caused by Zaire ebolavirus in individuals 
      12 months of age and older. METHODS: The Partnership for Research on Ebola 
      VACcination (PREVAC) is a multicenter, phase 2, randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled trial of 3 vaccine strategies in healthy children (ages 1-17) 
      and adults, with projected 5 years of follow-up (NCT02876328). Using validated 
      assays (GP-ELISA and PRNT), we measured antibody responses after 1-dose 
      rVSVDeltaG-ZEBOV-GP, 2-dose rVSVDeltaG-ZEBOV-GP (given on Day 0 and Day 56), or placebo. 
      Furthermore, we quantified vaccine virus shedding in a subset of children's 
      saliva using RT-PCR. RESULTS: In total, 819 children and 783 adults were 
      randomized to receive rVSVDeltaG-ZEBOV-GP (1 or 2 doses) or placebo. A single dose of 
      rVSVDeltaG-ZEBOV-GP increased antibody responses by Day 28 that were sustained 
      through Month 12. A second dose of rVSVDeltaG-ZEBOV-GP given on Day 56 transiently 
      boosted antibody concentrations. In vaccinated children, GP-ELISA titers were 
      superior to placebo and non-inferior to vaccinated adults. Vaccine virus shedding 
      was observed in 31.7% of children, peaking by Day 7, with no shedding observed 
      after Day 28 post-dose 1 or any time post-dose 2. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of 
      rVSVDeltaG-ZEBOV-GP induced robust antibody responses in children that was 
      non-inferior to the responses induced in vaccinated adults. Vaccine virus 
      shedding in children was time-limited and only observed after the first dose. 
      Overall, these data support the use of rVSVDeltaG-ZEBOV-GP for the prevention of EVD 
      in at-risk children. Clinical Trials Registration. The study is registered at 
      ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02876328), the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry 
      (PACTR201712002760250), and the European Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 
      number: 2017-001798-18).

TI  - Effect of anti-Ebola virus monoclonal antibodies on endogenous antibody 
      production in survivors of Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the 
      Congo: an observational cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of specific anti-Ebola virus therapy, especially monoclonal 
      antibodies, has improved survival in patients with Ebola virus disease. We aimed 
      to assess the effect of monoclonal antibodies on anti-Ebola virus antibody 
      responses in survivors of the 2018-20 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic 
      of the Congo. METHODS: In this observational prospective cohort study, 
      participants were enrolled at three Ebola survivor clinics in Beni, Mangina, and 
      Butembo (Democratic Republic of the Congo). Eligible children and adults notified 
      as survivors of Ebola virus disease (ie, who had confirmed Ebola virus disease 
      [RT-PCR positive in blood sample] and were subsequently declared recovered from 
      the virus [RT-PCR negative in blood sample] with a certificate of recovery from 
      Ebola virus disease issued by an Ebola treatment centre) during the 2018-20 Ebola 
      virus disease outbreak were invited to participate in the study. Participants 
      were recruited on discharge from Ebola treatment centres and followed up for 
      12-18 months depending on recruitment date. Routine follow-up assessments were 
      done at 1, 3, 6, and 12-18 months after inclusion. We collected sociodemographic 
      (age, sex, visit site), clinical (anti-Ebola virus drugs), and laboratory data 
      (RT-PCR and Ct values). The primary outcome was the antibody concentrations 
      against Ebola virus glycoprotein, nucleoprotein, and 40-kDa viral protein 
      antigens over time assessed in all participants. Antibody concentrations were 
      measured by the multiplex immunoassay, and the association between anti-Ebola 
      virus antibody levels and the relevant exposures, such as anti-Ebola virus 
      disease drugs (ansuvimab, REGN-EB3, ZMapp, or remdesivir), was assessed using 
      both linear and logistic mixed regression models. This study is registered at 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04409405. FINDINGS: Between April 16, 2020, and Oct 18, 
      2021, 1168 survivors were invited to participate in the Les Vainqueurs d'Ebola 
      cohort study. 787 survivors were included in the study, of whom 358 had data 
      available for antibody responses. 85 (24%) of 358 were seronegative for at least 
      two Ebola virus antigens on discharge from the Ebola treatment centre. The 
      antibody response over time fluctuated but a continuous decrease in an overall 
      linear evolution was observed. Quantitative modelling showed a decrease in 
      nucleoprotein, glycoprotein, and VP-40 antibody concentrations over time 
      (p<0.0001) with the fastest decrease observed for glycoprotein. The probability 
      of being seropositive for at least two antigens after 36 months was 53.6% (95% CI 
      51.6-55.6) for participants who received ansuvimab, 73.5% (71.5-75.5) for 
      participants who received REGN-EB3, 76.8% (74.8-78.8) for participants who 
      received remdesivir, and 78.5% (76.5-80.5) for participants who received ZMapp. 
      INTERPRETATION: Almost a quarter of survivors were seronegative on discharge from 
      the Ebola treatment centre and antibody concentrations decreased rapidly over 
      time. These results indicate that monoclonal antibodies might negatively affect 
      the production of anti-Ebola virus antibodies in survivors of Ebola virus disease 
      which could increase the risk of reinfection or reactivation. FUNDING: The French

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Various human viruses have been identified in wild monkeys and in 
      captive primates. Cases of transmission of viruses from wild monkeys to humans 
      and vice versa are known. The aim of this study was to identify markers of 
      anthroponotic viral infections in vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) 
      arrived from their natural habitat (Tanzania). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fecal 
      samples (n = 56) and blood serum samples (n = 75) obtained from 75 animals, 
      respectively, on days 10 and 23 after admission to the primate center, were 
      tested for the markers of anthroponotic viral infections (Ebola virus, Marburg 
      virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, hepatitis C virus, herpes simplex virus 
      (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), parainfluenza types 1 and 
      3, intestinal adenoviruses, rotaviruses) by enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) and 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Among the examined 
      animals, markers of 6 out of 11 tested viral infections were identified. 
      Detection rates of IgG antibodies to HSV-1,2 (15.9%) and CMV (15.9%) were two 
      times as low as IgG antibodies to EBV (31.8%). Among the markers of respiratory 
      viral infections, IgG antibodies to parainfluenza virus type 1 were found (6.8%). 
      14.3% of the animals had rotavirus antigen, and 94% had simian adenovirus DNA. 
      Markers of hemorrhagic fevers Ebola, Marburg, LCM, hepatitis C, and type 3 
      parainfluenza were not detected. CONCLUSION: When importing monkeys from 
      different regions of the world, an expanded screening for viral infections is 
      needed considering the epidemiological situation both in the country of 
      importation and in the country of destination.

TI  - Unexpected thermal stability of two enveloped megaviruses, Emiliania huxleyi 
      virus and African swine fever virus, as measured by viability PCR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The particle structure of Emiliania huxleyi virus (EhV), an algal 
      infecting member of nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs), contains an 
      outer lipid membrane envelope similar to that found in animal viruses such as 
      African swine fever virus (ASFV). Despite both being enveloped NCLDVs, EhV and 
      ASFV are known for their stability outside their host environment. METHOD: Here 
      we report for the first time, the application of a viability qPCR (V-qPCR) method 
      to describe the unprecedented and similar virion thermal stability of both EhV 
      and ASFV. This result contradicts the cell culture-based assay method that 
      suggests that virus "infectivity" is lost in a matter of seconds (for EhV) and 
      minutes (for ASFV) at temperature greater than 50  degrees C. Confocal microscopy and 
      analytical flow cytometry methods was used to validate the V-qPCR data for EhV. 
      RESULTS: We observed that both EhV and ASFV particles has unprecedented thermal 
      tolerances. These two NCLDVs are exceptions to the rule that having an enveloped 
      virion anatomy is a predicted weakness, as is often observed in enveloped RNA 
      viruses (i.e., the viruses causing Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome 
      (PRRS), COVID-19, Ebola, or seasonal influenza). Using the V-qPCR method, we 
      confirm that no PRRSV particles were detectable after 20 min of exposure to 
      temperatures up to 100  degrees C. We also show that the EhV particles that remain after 
      50  degrees C 20 min exposure was in fact still infectious only after the three blind 
      passages in bioassay experiments. CONCLUSIONS: This study raises the possibility 
      that ASFV is not always eliminated or contained after applying time and 
      temperature inactivation treatments in current decontamination or biosecurity 
      protocols. This observation has practical implications for industries involved in 
      animal health and food security. Finally, we propose that EhV could be used as a 
      surrogate for ASFV under certain circumstances.

AB  - The increasing demand for rapid, cost-effective, and reliable diagnostic tools in 
      personalized and point-of-care medicine is driving scientists to enhance existing 
      technology platforms and develop new methods for detecting and measuring 
      clinically significant biomarkers. Humanity is confronted with growing risks from 
      emerging and recurring infectious diseases, including the influenza virus, dengue 
      virus (DENV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola virus, tuberculosis, 
      cholera, and, most notably, SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19), among 
      others. Timely diagnosis of infections and effective disease control have always 
      been of paramount importance. Plasmonic-based biosensing holds the potential to 
      address the threat posed by infectious diseases by enabling prompt disease 
      monitoring. In recent years, numerous plasmonic platforms have risen to the 
      challenge of offering on-site strategies to complement traditional diagnostic 
      methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assays (ELISA). Disease detection can be accomplished through the utilization of 
      diverse plasmonic phenomena, such as propagating surface plasmon resonance (SPR), 
      localized SPR (LSPR), surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), surface-enhanced 
      fluorescence (SEF), surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, and 
      plasmonic fluorescence sensors. This review focuses on diagnostic methods 
      employing plasmonic fluorescence sensors, highlighting their pivotal role in 
      swift disease detection with remarkable sensitivity. It underscores the necessity 
      for continued research to expand the scope and capabilities of plasmonic 
      fluorescence sensors in the field of diagnostics.

LID - e0011390
AB  - Assay validation is an essential component of disease surveillance testing, but 
      can be problematic in settings where access to positive control material is 
      limited and a safety risk for handlers. Here we describe a single non-infectious 
      synthetic control that can help develop and validate the PCR based detection of 
      the viral causes of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus disease, Lassa 
      fever, Marburg virus disease and Rift Valley fever. We designed non-infectious 
      synthetic DNA oligonucleotide sequences incorporating primer binding sites 
      suitable for five assays, and a T7 promotor site which was used to transcribe the 
      sequence. Transcribed RNA was used as template in a dilution series, extracted 
      and amplified with RT-PCR and RT-qPCR to demonstrate successful recovery and 
      determine limits of detection in a range of laboratory settings. Our results show 
      this approach is adaptable to any diagnostic assay requiring validation of 
      nucleic acid extraction and/or amplification, particularly where sourcing 
      reliable, safe material for positive controls is infeasible.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Early isolation and care for Ebola disease patients at Ebola 
      Treatment Units (ETU) curb outbreak spread. We evaluated time to ETU entry and 
      associated factors during the 2022 Sudan virus disease (SVD) outbreak in Uganda. 
      METHODS: We included persons with RT-PCR-confirmed SVD with onset September 
      20-November 30, 2022. We categorized days from symptom onset to ETU entry 
      ("delays") as short (</=2), moderate (3-5), and long (>/=6); the latter two were 
      "delayed isolation." We categorized symptom onset timing as "earlier" or "later," 
      using October 15 as a cut-off. We assessed demographics, symptom onset timing, 
      and awareness of contact status as predictors for delayed isolation. We explored 
      reasons for early vs late isolation using key informant interviews. RESULTS: 
      Among 118 case-patients, 25 (21%) had short, 43 (36%) moderate, and 50 (43%) long 
      delays. Seventy-five (64%) had symptom onset later in the outbreak. Earlier 
      symptom onset increased risk of delayed isolation (crude risk ratio = 1.8, 95% 
      confidence interval (1.2-2.8]). Awareness of contact status and SVD symptoms, and 
      belief that early treatment-seeking was lifesaving facilitated early 
      care-seeking. Patients with long delays reported fear of ETUs and lack of 
      transport as contributors. CONCLUSION: Delayed isolation was common early in the 
      outbreak. Strong contact tracing and community engagement could expedite 
      presentation to ETUs.

AB  - Sosuga virus (SOSV), a rare human pathogenic paramyxovirus, was first discovered 
      in 2012 when a person became ill after working in South Sudan and Uganda. During 
      an ecological investigation, several species of bats were sampled and tested for 
      SOSV RNA and only one species, the Egyptian rousette bat (ERBs; Rousettus 
      aegyptiacus), tested positive. Since that time, multiple other species have been 
      sampled and ERBs in Uganda have continued to be the only species of bat positive 
      for SOSV infection. Subsequent studies of ERBs with SOSV demonstrated that ERBs 
      are a competent host for SOSV and shed this infectious virus while exhibiting 
      only minor infection-associated pathology. Following the 2014 Ebola outbreak in 
      West Africa, surveillance efforts focused on discovering reservoirs for zoonotic 
      pathogens resulted in the capture and testing of many bat species. Here, SOSV RNA 
      was detected by qRT-PCR only in ERBs captured in the Moyamba District of Sierra 
      Leone in the central region of the country. These findings represent a 
      substantial range extension from East Africa to West Africa for SOSV, suggesting 
      that this paramyxovirus may occur in ERB populations throughout its sub-Saharan 
      African range.

AB  - Human Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreaks caused by persistent EBOV infection raises 
      questions on the role of zoonotic spillover in filovirus epidemiology. To 
      characterise filovirus zoonotic exposure, we collected cross-sectional serum 
      samples from bushmeat hunters (n = 498) in Macenta Prefecture Guinea, adjacent to 
      the index site of the 2013 EBOV-Makona spillover event. We identified distinct 
      immune signatures (20/498, 4.0%) to multiple EBOV antigens (GP, NP, VP40) using 
      stepwise ELISA and Western blot analysis and, live EBOV neutralisation (5/20; 
      25%). Using comparative serological data from PCR-confirmed survivors of the 
      2013-2016 EBOV outbreak, we demonstrated that most signatures (15/20) were not 
      plausibly explained by prior EBOV-Makona exposure. Subsequent data-driven 
      modelling of EBOV immunological outcomes to remote-sensing environmental data 
      also revealed consistent associations with intact closed canopy forest. Together 
      our findings suggest exposure to other closely related filoviruses prior to the 
      2013-2016 West Africa epidemic and highlight future surveillance priorities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: On 20 September 2022, Uganda declared its fifth Sudan virus disease 
      (SVD) outbreak, culminating in 142 confirmed and 22 probable cases. The 
      reproductive rate (R) of this outbreak was 1.25. We described persons who were 
      exposed to the virus, became infected, and they led to the infection of an 
      unusually high number of cases during the outbreak. METHODS: In this descriptive 
      cross-sectional study, we defined a super-spreader person (SSP) as any person 
      with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed SVD linked to the 
      infection of >/= 13 other persons (10-fold the outbreak R). We reviewed illness 
      narratives for SSPs collected through interviews. Whole-genome sequencing was 
      used to support epidemiologic linkages between cases. RESULTS: Two SSPs (Patient 
      A, a 33-year-old male, and Patient B, a 26-year-old male) were identified, and 
      linked to the infection of one probable and 50 confirmed secondary cases. Both 
      SSPs lived in the same parish and were likely infected by a single ill healthcare 
      worker in early October while receiving healthcare. Both sought treatment at 
      multiple health facilities, but neither was ever isolated at an Ebola Treatment 
      Unit (ETU). In total, 18 secondary cases (17 confirmed, one probable), including 
      three deaths (17%), were linked to Patient A; 33 secondary cases (all confirmed), 
      including 14 (42%) deaths, were linked to Patient B. Secondary cases linked to 
      Patient A included family members, neighbours, and contacts at health facilities, 
      including healthcare workers. Those linked to Patient B included healthcare 
      workers, friends, and family members who interacted with him throughout his 
      illness, prayed over him while he was nearing death, or exhumed his body. 
      Intensive community engagement and awareness-building were initiated based on 
      narratives collected about patients A and B; 49 (96%) of the secondary cases were 
      isolated in an ETU, a median of three days after onset. Only nine tertiary cases 
      were linked to the 51 secondary cases. Sequencing suggested plausible direct 
      transmission from the SSPs to 37 of 39 secondary cases with sequence data. 
      CONCLUSION: Extended time in the community while ill, social interactions, 
      cross-district travel for treatment, and religious practices contributed to SVD 
      super-spreading. Intensive community engagement and awareness may have reduced 
      the number of tertiary infections. Intensive follow-up of contacts of 
      case-patients may help reduce the impact of super-spreading events.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2022, an Ebola disease outbreak caused by Sudan virus (SUDV) 
      occurred in Uganda, primarily affecting Mubende and Kassanda districts. We 
      determined risk factors for SUDV infection among household members (HHM) of 
      cases. METHODS: We conducted a case-control and retrospective cohort study in 
      January 2023. Cases were RT-PCR-confirmed SUDV infection in residents of Mubende 
      or Kassanda districts during the outbreak. Case-households housed a symptomatic, 
      primary case-patient for >/= 24 h and had >/= 1 secondary case-patient with onset < 2 
      weeks after their last exposure to the primary case-patient. Control households 
      housed a case-patient and other HHM but no secondary cases. A risk factor 
      questionnaire was administered to the primary case-patient or another adult who 
      lived at home while the primary case-patient was ill. We conducted a 
      retrospective cohort study among case-household members and categorized their 
      interactions with primary case-patients during their illnesses as none, minimal, 
      indirect, and direct contact. We conducted logistic regression to explore 
      associations between exposures and case-household status, and Poisson regression 
      to identify risk factors for SUDV infection among HHM. RESULTS: Case- and 
      control-households had similar median sizes. Among 19 case-households and 51 
      control households, primary case-patient death (adjusted odds ratio 
      [OR(adj)] = 7.6, 95% CI 1.4-41) and >/= 2 household bedrooms (OR(adj)=0.19, 95% CI 
      0.056-0.71) were associated with case-household status. In the cohort of 76 
      case-HHM, 44 (58%) were tested for SUDV < 2 weeks from their last contact with 
      the primary case-patient; 29 (38%) were positive. Being aged >/= 18 years (adjusted 
      risk ratio [aRR(adj)] = 1.9, 95%CI: 1.01-3.7) and having direct or indirect 
      contact with the primary case-patient (aRR(adj)=3.2, 95%CI: 1.1-9.7) compared to 
      minimal or no contact increased risk of Sudan virus disease (SVD). Access to a 
      handwashing facility decreased risk (aRR(adj)=0.52, 95%CI: 0.31-0.88). 
      CONCLUSION: Direct contact, particularly providing nursing care for and sharing 
      sleeping space with SVD patients, increased infection risk among HHM. Risk 
      assessments during contact tracing may provide evidence to justify closer 
      monitoring of some HHM. Health messaging should highlight the risk of sharing 
      sleeping spaces and providing nursing care for persons with Ebola disease 
      symptoms and emphasize hand hygiene to aid early case identification and reduce 
      transmission.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Travel-related strategies to reduce the spread of COVID-19 evolved 
      rapidly in response to changes in the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and newly 
      available tools for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Modeling is an 
      important methodology to investigate the range of outcomes that could occur from 
      different disease containment strategies. METHODS: We examined 43 articles 
      published from December 2019 through September 2022 that used modeling to 
      evaluate travel-related COVID-19 containment strategies. We extracted and 
      synthesized data regarding study objectives, methods, outcomes, populations, 
      settings, strategies, and costs. We used a standardized approach to evaluate each 
      analysis according to 26 criteria for modeling quality and rigor. RESULTS: The 
      most frequent approaches included compartmental modeling to examine quarantine, 
      isolation, or testing. Early in the pandemic, the goal was to prevent 
      travel-related COVID-19 cases with a focus on individual-level outcomes and 
      assessing strategies such as travel restrictions, quarantine without testing, 
      social distancing, and on-arrival PCR testing. After the development of 
      diagnostic tests and vaccines, modeling studies projected population-level 
      outcomes and investigated these tools to limit COVID-19 spread. Very few 
      published studies included rapid antigen screening strategies, costs, explicit 
      model calibration, or critical evaluation of the modeling approaches. CONCLUSION: 
      Future modeling analyses should leverage open-source data, improve the 
      transparency of modeling methods, incorporate newly available prevention, 
      diagnostics, and treatments, and include costs and cost-effectiveness so that 
      modeling analyses can be informative to address future SARS-CoV-2 variants of 
      concern and other emerging infectious diseases (e.g., mpox and Ebola) for 
      travel-related health policies.

TI  - Rapid detection of Ebolavirus using isothermal recombinase-aided amplification.
PG  - e29744
LID - 10.1002/jmv.29744 [doi]
AB  - Ebolavirus disease (EVD) is an often-lethal disease caused by the genus 
      Ebolavirus (EBOV). Although vaccines are being developed and recently used, 
      outbreak control still relies on a combination of various factors, including 
      rapid identification of EVD cases. This allows rapid patient isolation and 
      control measure implementation. Ebolavirus diagnosis is performed in treatment 
      centers or reference laboratories, which usually takes a few hours to days to 
      confirm the outbreak or deliver a clear result. A fast and field-deployable 
      molecular detection method, such as the isothermal amplification 
      recombinase-aided amplification (RAA), could significantly reduce 
      sample-to-result time. In this study, a RT-RAA assay was evaluated for EBOV 
      detection. Various primer and probe combinations were screened; analytical 
      sensitivity and cross-specificity were tested. A total of 40 archived samples 
      from the 2014 to 2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa were tested with both the 
      reference method real-time RT-PCR and the established RT-RAA assay. The assay 
      could detect down to 22.6 molecular copies per microliter. No other pathogens 
      were detected with the Ebolavirus RT-RAA assay. Testing 40 samples yield clinical 
      sensitivity and specificity of 100% each. This rapid isothermal RT-RAA assay can 
      replace the previous RT-RPA and continue to offer rapid EBOV diagnostics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: 10 million people are chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus 
      (HCV) in sub-Saharan Africa. The assessment of viral genotypes and treatment 
      response in this region is necessary to achieve the WHO target of worldwide 
      elimination of viral hepatitis by 2030. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of 
      HCV genotypes and outcomes of treatment with direct-acting antiviral agents in 
      Benin, a country with a national HCV seroprevalence of 4%. METHODS: This 
      prospective cohort study was conducted at two referral hospitals in Benin. 
      Individuals were eligible for inclusion if they were seropositive for HCV and 
      willing to consent to participation in the study; exclusion criteria were an 
      inability to give consent or incarceration. Viraemia was confirmed by PCR. The 
      primary outcomes were to identify HCV genotypes and measure sustained virological 
      response rates 12 weeks after completion of treatment (SVR12) with a 12-week 
      course of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir or sofosbuvir-ledipasvir, with or without 
      ribavirin. We conducted phylogenetic and resistance analyses after the 
      next-generation sequencing of samples with a cycle threshold (Ct) value of 30 or 
      fewer cycles. The in-vitro efficacy of NS5A inhibitors was tested using a 
      subgenomic replicon assay. FINDINGS: Between June 2, 2019, and Dec 30, 2020, 148 
      individuals were screened for eligibility, of whom 100 were recruited 
      prospectively to the study. Plasma samples from 79 (79%) of the 100 participants 
      were positive for HCV by PCR. At the time of the study, 52 (66%) of 79 patients 
      had completed treatment, with an SVR12 rate of 94% (49 of 52). 57 (72%) of 79 
      samples had a Ct value of 30 or fewer cycles and were suitable for whole-genome 
      sequencing, from which we characterised 29 (51%) samples as genotype 1 and 28 
      (49%) as genotype 2. Three new genotype 1 subtypes (1q, 1r, and 1s) and one new 
      genotype 2 subtype (2xa) were identified. The most commonly detected subtype was 
      2d (12 [21%] of 57 samples), followed by 1s (eight [14%]), 1r (five [9%]), 1b 
      (four [7%]), 1q (three [5%]), 2xa (three [5%]), and 2b (two [3%]). 20 samples (11 
      genotype 2 and nine genotype 1) were unassigned new singleton lineages. 53 (93%) 
      of 57 sequenced samples had at least two resistance-associated substitutions 
      within the NS5A gene. Subtype 2d was associated with a lower-than-expected SVR12 
      rate (eight [80%] of ten patients). For one patient, with subtype 2b, treatment 
      was not successful. INTERPRETATION: This study revealed a high SVR rate in Benin 
      among individuals treated for HCV with sofosbuvir-velpatasvir, including those 
      with highly diverse viral genotypes. Further studies of treatment effectiveness 
      in genotypes 2d and 2b are indicated. FUNDING: Medical Research Council,

AB  - Within the fields of infectious disease diagnostics, microfluidic-based 
      integrated technology systems have become a vital technology in enhancing the 
      rapidity, accuracy, and portability of pathogen detection. These systems 
      synergize microfluidic techniques with advanced molecular biology methods, 
      including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), loop-mediated 
      isothermal amplification (LAMP), and clustered regularly interspaced short 
      palindromic repeats (CRISPR), have been successfully used to identify a diverse 
      array of pathogens, including COVID-19, Ebola, Zika, and dengue fever. This 
      review outlines the advances in pathogen detection, attributing them to the 
      integration of microfluidic technology with traditional molecular biology methods 
      and smartphone- and paper-based diagnostic assays. The cutting-edge diagnostic 
      technologies are of critical importance for disease prevention and epidemic 
      surveillance. Looking ahead, research is expected to focus on increasing 
      detection sensitivity, streamlining testing processes, reducing costs, and 
      enhancing the capability for remote data sharing. These improvements aim to 
      achieve broader coverage and quicker response mechanisms, thereby constructing a 
      more robust defense for global public health security.

      epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: a retrospective test-negative 
      study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-Zaire Ebola virus 
      (rVSV-ZEBOV) vaccine is the only WHO prequalified vaccine recommended for use to 
      respond to outbreaks of Ebola virus (species Zaire ebolavirus) by WHO's Strategic 
      Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization. Despite the vaccine's widespread use 
      during several outbreaks, no real-world effectiveness estimates are currently 
      available in the literature. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective test-negative 
      analysis to estimate effectiveness of rVSV-ZEBOV vaccination against Ebola virus 
      disease during the 2018-20 epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
      using data on suspected Ebola virus disease cases collected from Ebola treatment 
      centres. Those eligible for inclusion had an available Ebola virus RT-PCR result, 
      available key data, were eligible for vaccination during the outbreak, and had 
      symptom onset aligning with the period in which a ring-vaccination protocol was 
      in use. After imputing missing data, each individual confirmed by RT-PCR to be 
      Ebola virus disease-positive (defined as a case) was matched to one individual 
      negative for Ebola virus disease (control) by sex, age, health zone, and month of 
      symptom onset. Effectiveness was estimated from the odds ratio of being 
      vaccinated (>/=10 days before symptom onset) versus being unvaccinated among cases 
      and controls, after adjusting for the matching factors. The imputation, matching 
      and effectiveness estimation, was repeated 500 times. FINDINGS: 1273 (4.8%) of 
      26 438 eligible individuals were positive for Ebola virus disease (cases) and 
      25 165 (95.2%) were negative (controls). 40 (3.1%) cases and 1271 (5.1%) controls 
      were reported as being vaccinated at least 10 days before symptom onset. After 
      selecting individuals who reported exposure to an individual with Ebola virus 
      disease within the 21 days before symptom onset and matching, the analysis 
      datasets comprised a median of 309 cases and 309 controls. 10 days or more after 
      vaccination, the effectiveness of rVSV-ZEBOV against Ebola virus disease was 
      estimated to be 84% (95% credible interval 70-92). INTERPRETATION: This analysis 
      is the first to provide estimates of the real-world effectiveness of the 
      rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine against Ebola virus disease, amid the widespread use of the 
      vaccine during a large Ebola virus disease outbreak. Our findings confirm that 
      rVSV-ZEBOV is highly protective against Ebola virus disease and support its use 
      during outbreaks, even in challenging contexts such as in the eastern Democratic 
      Republic of the Congo. FUNDING: Medecins Sans Frontieres. TRANSLATION: For the

AB  - The 2018-2020 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of 
      the Congo (DRC) was the largest since the disease's discovery in 1976. Rapid 
      identification and isolation of EVD patients are crucial during triage. This 
      study aimed to develop a clinical prediction score for EVD using clinical and 
      epidemiological predictors. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study 
      using surveillance data from EVD outbreak, collected during routine clinical care 
      at the Ebola Transit Center (ETC) in Beni, DRC, from 2018 to 2020. The 
      Spiegelhalter and Knill-Jones method was used for score development, including 
      potential predictors with an adjusted likelihood ratio above 2 or below 0.50. 
      Validation was performed using a dataset previously published in PLOSOne by 
      Tshomba et al. Among 3725 patients screened, 3698 fulfilled the inclusion 
      criteria, with 571 (15.4%) testing positive for EVD via RT-PCR Test. Seven 
      predictive factors were identified: asthenia, sore throat, conjunctivitis, 
      bleeding gums, hematemesis, contact with a sick person, and contact with a 
      traditional healer. The prediction score achieved an Area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.764, with 81.4% sensitivity and 53.6% 
      specificity at a -1 cutoff. External validation demonstrated an AUROC of 0.766, 
      with 80.8% sensitivity and 41.4% specificity at the -1 cutoff. Our study 
      developed a screening tool to assess the risk of suspected patients developing 
      EVD and being admitted to ETUs for RT-PCR testing and treatment. External 
      validation results affirmed the model's reliability and generalizability in 
      similar settings, suggesting its potential integration into clinical practice. 
      Given the severity and urgency of EVD as well as the risk nosocomial EVD 
      transmission, it is essential to continuously update these models with real-time 
      data on symptoms, disease progression, patient outcomes and validated RDT during 
      EVD outbreaks. This approach will enhance model accuracy, enabling more precise 
      risk assessments and more effective outbreak management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the 2018-20 Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Democratic 
      Republic of the Congo, thousands of patients received unprecedented vaccination, 
      monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy, or both, leading to a large number of 
      survivors. We aimed to report the clinical, virological, viral genomic, and 
      immunological features of two previously vaccinated and mAb-treated survivors of 
      Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo who developed second 
      episodes of disease months after initial discharge, ultimately complicated by 
      fatal meningoencephalitis associated with viral persistence. METHODS: In this 
      case report study, we describe the presentation, management, and subsequent 
      investigations of two patients who developed recrudescent Ebola virus disease and 
      subsequent fatal meningoencephalitis. We obtained data from epidemiological 
      databases, Ebola treatment units, survivor programme databases, laboratory 
      datasets, and hospital records. Following national protocols established during 
      the 2018-20 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, blood, plasma, and 
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected during the first and second 
      episodes of Ebola virus disease from both individuals and were analysed by 
      molecular (quantitative RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing) and serological 
      (IgG and IgM ELISA and Luminex assays) techniques. FINDINGS: The total time 
      between the end of the first Ebola virus episode and the onset of the second 
      episode was 342 days for patient 1 and 137 days for patient 2. In both patients, 
      Ebola virus RNA was detected in blood and CSF samples during the second episode 
      of disease. Complete genomes from CSF samples from this relapse episode showed 
      phylogenetic relatedness to the genome sequenced from blood samples collected 
      from the initial infection, confirming in-host persistence of Ebola virus. 
      Serological analysis showed an antigen-specific humoral response with typical IgM 
      and IgG kinetics in patient 1, but an absence of an endogenous adaptive immune 
      response in patient 2. INTERPRETATION: We report the first two cases of fatal 
      meningoencephalitis associated with Ebola virus persistence in two survivors of 
      Ebola virus disease who had received vaccination and mAb-based treatment in the 
      Democratic Republic of the Congo. Our findings highlight the importance of 
      long-term monitoring of survivors, including continued clinical, virological, and 
      immunological profiling, as well as the urgent need for novel therapeutic 
      strategies to prevent and mitigate the individual and public health consequences 
      of Ebola virus persistence. FUNDING: Ministry of Health of the Democratic

AB  - Bats are important natural hosts of various zoonotic viruses, including Ebola 
      virus, Lyssa virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). 
      Although investigation of bats is valuable for predicting emerging infectious 
      diseases from these animals, few surveys of bat-derived viruses have been 
      conducted in Japan. In the present study, samples were collected from a total of 
      132 bats of 4 different species from 4 different locations within Yamaguchi 
      Prefecture; these sample were employed for comprehensive detection of bat-derived 
      viruses by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR 
      using primers universal for each of 4 different viral classes. As a result of PCR 
      and RT-PCR, various herpesviruses, astroviruses, coronaviruses, and adenoviruses 
      were identified from a total of 80 bats. The detected herpesviruses belong to the 
      Betaherpesvirinae or Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily, the detected adenoviruses to 
      the genus Mastadenovirus, the detected astroviruses to the genus Mamastrovirus; 
      and the detected coronaviruses belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus. The detected 
      sequences of 12 strains of 4 families showed 100 % amino acid identity with 
      viruses previously detected either in China or South Korea. These findings expand 
      our understanding of viruses carried by bats, and provide insights into the 
      nature of bat-derived viruses in Japan.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In September 2022, Uganda experienced an outbreak of Sudan virus 
      disease (SVD), mainly in central Uganda. As a result of enhanced surveillance 
      activities for Ebola disease, samples from several patients with suspected viral 
      hemorrhagic fever (VHF) were sent to the VHF Program at Uganda Virus Research 
      Institute (UVRI), Entebbe, Uganda, and identified with infections caused by other 
      viral etiologies. Herein, we report the epidemiologic and laboratory findings of 
      Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) cases that were detected during the SVD 
      outbreak response. METHODOLOGY: Whole blood samples from VHF suspected cases were 
      tested for Sudan virus (SUDV) by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
      reaction (RT-PCR); and if negative, were tested for CCHF virus (CCHFV) by RT-PCR. 
      CCHFV genomic sequences generated by metagenomic next generation sequencing were 
      analyzed to ascertain strain relationships. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Between September 
      2022 and January 2023, a total of 2,626 samples were submitted for VHF testing at 
      UVRI. Overall, 13 CCHF cases (including 7 deaths; case fatality rate of 53.8%), 
      aged 4 to 60 years, were identified from 10 districts, including several 
      districts affected by the SVD outbreak. Four cases were identified within the 
      Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) at Mubende Hospital. Most CCHF cases were males 
      engaged in livestock farming or had exposure to wildlife (n = 8; 61.5%). Among 
      confirmed cases, the most common clinical symptoms were hemorrhage (n = 12; 
      92.3%), fever (n = 11; 84.6%), anorexia (n = 10; 76.9%), fatigue (n = 9; 69.2%), 
      abdominal pain (n = 9; 69.2%) and vomiting (n = 9; 69.2%). Sequencing analysis 
      showed that the majority of identified CCHFV strains belonged to the Africa II 
      clade previously identified in Uganda. Two samples, however, were identified with 
      greater similarity to a CCHFV strain that was last reported in Uganda in 1958, 
      suggesting possible reemergence. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Identifying CCHFV from 
      individuals initially suspected to be infected with SUDV emphasizes the need for 
      comprehensive VHF testing during filovirus outbreak responses in VHF endemic 
      countries. Without expanded testing, CCHFV-infected patients would have posed a 
      risk to health care workers and others while receiving treatment after a negative 
      filovirus diagnosis, thereby complicating response dynamics. Additionally, 
      CCHFV-infected cases could acquire an Ebola infection while in the ETU, and upon 
      release because of a negative Ebola virus result, have the potential to spread 
      these infections in the community.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies and reports 
      comparing the performance of antigen rapid diagnostic tests (Ag RDT) for 
      diagnosing Ebola disease (EVD). We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science 
      for diagnostic studies published between 1976 and 2023, evaluating them with 
      QUADAS-2. Using a bivariate random-effects model, we estimated the pooled 
      sensitivity and specificity of Ag RDTs. Of 64 eligible full studies and reports, 
      16 met the inclusion criteria. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 82.1% 
      (95%CI: 75.2 - 88.0) and 97.0% (95%CI: 95.1-98.2), respectively. We conducted 
      subgroup analysis on 4 Ag RDTs, 3 RT-PCR tests, and 4 sample types, showing 
      varied performance. The high specificity and positive predictive value of Ag RDTs 
      support their use to "rule-in" patients with EVD. However, high-sensitivity RDTs 
      suitable for field settings and capable of detecting multiple ebolavirus species 
      are needed.

TI  - rVSV-ZEBOV vaccination in people with pre-existing immunity to Ebolavirus: an 
      open-label safety and immunogenicity study in Guinean communities affected by 
      Ebola virus disease (l'essai proches).
PG  - 523

LID - 523
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zaire Ebolavirus disease (EVD) outbreaks can be controlled using 
      rVSV-ZEBOV vaccination and other public health measures. People in high-risk 
      areas may have pre-existing antibodies from asymptomatic Ebolavirus exposure that 
      might affect response to rVSV-ZEBOV. Therefore, we assessed the impact 
      pre-existing immunity had on post-vaccination IgG titre, virus neutralisation, 
      and reactogenicity following vaccination. METHODS: In this prospective cohort 
      study, 2115 consenting close contacts ("proches") of EVD survivors were 
      recruited. Proches were vaccinated with rVSV-ZEBOV and followed up for 28 days 
      for safety and immunogenicity. Anti-GP IgG titre at baseline and day 28 was 
      assessed by ELISA. Samples from a representative subset were evaluated using live 
      virus neutralisation. RESULTS: Ten percent were seropositive at baseline. At day 
      28, IgG in baseline seronegative (GMT 0.106 IU/ml, 95% CI: 0.100 to 0.113) and 
      seropositive (GMT 0.237 IU/ml, 0.210 to 0.267) participants significantly 
      increased from baseline (both p < 0.0001). There was strong correlation between 
      antibody titres and virus neutralisation in day 28 samples (Spearman's rho 0.75). 
      Vaccinees with baseline IgG antibodies against Zaire Ebolavirus had similar 
      safety profiles to those without detectable antibodies (63.6% vs 66.1% adults 
      experienced any adverse event; 49.1% vs 60.9% in children), with almost all 
      adverse events graded as mild. No serious adverse events were attributed to 
      vaccination. No EVD survivors tested positive for Ebolavirus by RT-PCR. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These data add further evidence of rVSV-ZEBOV safety and 
      immunogenicity, including in people with pre-existing antibodies from suspected 
      natural ZEBOV infection whose state does not blunt rVSV-ZEBOV immune response. 
      Pre-vaccination serological screening is not required.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivors develop post-acute 
      ophthalmic sequelae, including a high prevalence of uveitis that may be 
      complicated by vision-threatening cataract. After the non-detection of Ebola 
      virus (EBOV) RNA in sampled ocular fluid, vision impairment due to cataract can 
      be treated safely and effectively via manual small incision cataract surgery 
      (MSICS). However, the long-term ocular visual outcomes and assessment of ocular 
      tissues, including for genomic RNA, have been infrequently or not reported in 
      Western African survivors. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A cohort of EVD survivors with 
      visually significant cataract, in whom EBOV RNA was not detected by RT-PCR 
      testing of ocular fluid sampled prior to MSICS, were followed for a year after 
      intraocular lens replacement. Ophthalmic outcomes, including visual acuity (VA), 
      adverse events, and follow-up examinations, were recorded. Ocular tissue 
      specimens obtained at MSICS underwent histopathologic examination and in-situ 
      hybridization (ISH) targeting EBOV genomic RNA. RESULTS: Thirty-four EVD 
      survivors underwent MSICS and were included for analysis. The median age of EVD 
      survivors who underwent surgery at enrollment was 22.5 years (Interquartile 
      range, IQR: 16.5-33) and the cohort was comprised of 20 females (58.8%). Median 
      logMAR VA at preoperative baseline was 3 (IQR: 1-3) which improved to 0.4 (IQR: 
      0-0.6; n = 10; p = 0.002) and 0.6 (IQR: 0.18-0.78; n = 18; p < 0.0001) at 6- and 
      12-months following surgery, respectively. EBOV RNA was not detected in 7 
      cataract and capsular tissue specimens obtained at the time of MSICS. 
      CONCLUSIONS: After MSICS, meaningful improvement in vision was maintained in EVD 
      survivors at long-term follow-up. EBOV RNA was not detected in cataract and lens 
      capsule specimens, providing additional reassurance of the low risk of EBOV RNA 
      exposure during cataract surgery. Further study is needed to understand long-term 
      ocular outcomes, including adverse events, in this population. AUTHOR SUMMARY: 
      Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivors may develop several ophthalmic sequelae 
      including uveitis and cataract that may lead to severe vision loss if left 
      untreated. Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS) has been utilized to 
      treat cataract in EVD survivors with encouraging short-term outcomes, but the 
      long-term visual acuity outcomes and the potential for Ebola virus RNA to reside 
      in cataract material is unknown. In this study, we reported long-term visual 
      acuity outcomes following MSICS in a cohort of EVD survivors along with 
      histopathology findings from materials collected during surgery. Visual acuity 
      improved over 12-month follow-up with encouraging safety measures. Ebola virus 
      RNA was not detected in cataract and lens capsular tissue analyzed from EVD 
      survivors. This study provides additional assurance regarding the safety and 
      efficacy of cataract surgery, with potential for improved vision for EVD 
      survivors.

      How They Work and How to Combine Them.

AB  - In this review, recent advances in the combination of CRISPR-Cas systems with 
      graphene-based electrolyte-gated transistors are discussed in detail. In the 
      first part, the functioning of CRISPR-Cas systems is briefly explained, as well 
      as the most common ways to convert their molecular activity into measurable 
      signals. Other than optical means, conventional electrochemical transducers are 
      also developed. However, it seems that the incorporation of CRISPR/Cas systems 
      into transistor devices could be extremely powerful, as the former provides 
      molecular amplification, while the latter provides electrical amplification; 
      combined, the two could help to advance in terms of sensitivity and compete with 
      conventional PCR assays. Today, organic transistors suffer from poor stability in 
      biological media, whereas graphene materials perform better by being extremely 
      sensitive to their chemical environment and being stable. The need for fast and 
      inexpensive sensors to detect viral RNA arose on the occasion of the COVID-19 
      crisis, but many other RNA viruses are of interest, such as dengue, hepatitis C, 
      hepatitis E, West Nile fever, Ebola, and polio, for which detection means are 
      needed.

AB  - A key lesson from the west Africa (2014-16) Ebola disease epidemic was that 
      outbreak responses fail when they respond to patients through a narrow clinical 
      lens without considering the broader community and social context of care. Here, 
      in the second of two Series papers on the modern landscape of Ebola disease, we 
      review progress made in the last decade to improve patient-centred care. Although 
      the biosafety imperatives of treating Ebola disease remain, recent advances show 
      how to mitigate these so that patients are cared for in a safe and dignified 
      manner that encourages early treatment-seeking behaviour and provides support 
      after the return of patients to their communities. We review advances in 
      diagnostics, including faster Ebola disease detection via real-time RT-PCR, and 
      consider design improvements in Ebola disease treatment units that enhance 
      patient safety and dignity. We also review advances in care provision, such as 
      the integration of palliative care and mobile communication into routine care, 
      and address how greater access to research is possible through harmonised 
      clinical trials. Finally, we discuss how strengthened community engagement and 
      psychosocial programmes are addressing stigma and providing holistic support for 
      survivors.

TI  - Plant cross-fertilization for production of dual-specific antibodies targeting 
      both Ebola virus-like particles and HER2 protein in F(1) plants.
PG  - 425-433
LID - 10.1007/s13258-025-01616-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study explores the cross-fertilization of transgenic tobacco 
      plants to produce dual-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting Ebola 
      virus-like particles and HER2 proteins. We generated F(1) plants by hybridizing 
      individual transgenic lines expressing the anti-HER2 breast cancer VHH mAb (HV) 
      and the H-13F6 human anti-Ebola large single chain mAb (EL). OBJECTIVE: 
      Hybridizing transgenic plants to express dual-antibodies between different 
      structures VHH and LSCK indicate the potential of transgenic plants as a 
      cost-effective and scalable production system for dual targeting mAbs. METHODS: 
      We performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis to confirm the integration 
      of EL and HV genes in the F(1) progeny. The reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR and 
      immunoblotting were performed to confirm the expression of transgenes. Indirect 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was conducted to confirm the functionality of 
      purified EL and HV mAb. RESULTS: A PCR analysis confirmed the successful 
      integration of both EL and HV mAb genes in the F(1) progeny. Additionally, 
      (RT)-PCR and immunoblotting validated the expression of these transgenes, with EL 
      and HV mAbs purified from the F(1) plants. Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay (ELISA) demonstrated that EL x HV mAb proteins maintained binding activity 
      to Ebola virus-specific antigens, comparable to that of the EL mAb protein, while 
      also exhibiting binding activity against HER2 proteins similar to that of the HV 
      mAb. CONCLUSION: This study indicates the potential for transgenic plants to 
      produce dually targeting mAbs, suggesting a promising application in enabling the 
      co-expression of antibodies targeting two different diseases in a single plant.

TI  - Elucidating Infectious Causes of Fever of Unknown Origin: A Laboratory-Based 
      Observational Study of Patients with Suspected Ebola Virus Disease, Guinea, 2014.
PG  - 101-112
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiae637 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The etiology of fever of unknown origin (FUO) in sub-Saharan Africa 
      often remains unexplained. METHODS: We performed a retrospective laboratory-based 
      observational study of 550 Guinean patients with FUO testing negative for Ebola 
      virus from March to December 2014. Blood-borne pathogens were diagnosed by 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), serologic 
      tests, and targeted and unbiased high-throughput sequencing (HTS). RESULTS: In 
      275 of 550 individuals, we found evidence of >/=1 pathogen by molecular methods. We 
      identified Plasmodium in 35.6% of patients via PCR, with P falciparum 
      constituting 96.4% of these cases. Pathogenic bacteria, including Salmonella and 
      Klebsiella, were detected in 18.4% of patients through PCR and HTS. Resistance 
      determinants against first-line antibiotics were found in 26.9% of pooled sera by 
      HTS. Yellow fever, Lassa, and Ebola viruses were detected in 5.8% of patients by 
      RT-PCR; HTS-guided RT-PCR confirmed Orungo virus infection in 1 patient. 
      Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the viral genomes matched the available 
      genomic data in terms of location and time. Indirect immunofluorescence assays 
      revealed immunoglobulin M antibodies against yellow fever, Ebola, dengue, West 
      Nile, and Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses in 11 of 100 patients who were 
      PCR or RT-PCR negative. One in 5 patients who were infected presented 
      coinfections, predominantly malaria associated with sepsis-causing bacteria, in 
      adults (12.1%) and children (12.5%), whereas viral coinfections were rare. 
      Patients presented fever (74.7%), asthenia (67.7%), emesis (38.2%), diarrhea 
      (28.3%), and hemorrhage (11.8%), without clear etiology associations. 
      CONCLUSIONS: An exhaustive laboratory investigation elucidated infectious causes 
      of FUO in 52.3% of patients. Quality control and strengthening laboratory 
      capacities in sub-Saharan Africa are essential for patient care, outbreak 
      response, and regionally appropriate diagnostics.

TI  - Maternal and fetal survival following Ebola, HIV and Malaria co-infection in the 
      first trimester of gestation in resource-limited setting in Democratic Republic 
      of Congo.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ebola-HIV and malaria co-infection is one of the rare clinical 
      situations that remains complex to manage even in the context of unlimited 
      resources. In pregnancy, each of these infections can compromise maternal and 
      fetal outcomes. The synergy of their effects on maternal immunity are often 
      fatal, and survival is an exception, especially in a context of limited 
      resources, such as in Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs). CASE PRESENTATION: Our 
      22-year-old patient, weighing 56 kg and nine weeks pregnant was admitted to the 
      ETU during the 10th outbreak in DRC. She had HIV and had abandoned antiretroviral 
      treatment (ART) seven months before. One month before her admission, her HIV 
      viral load was high with a low CD4(+) T cell count. She was vaccinated against 
      EVD with rVSV-ZEBOV four days before her symptoms. She appeared generally in 
      ill-health but her vital signs were within normal range. Without ultrasound, the 
      fetal vitality could not be assessed. Laboratory tests confirmed malaria, 
      pregnancy, HIV, and Ebola infection through RT-PCR. She received supportive 
      treatment and a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb114). On the 2nd day, we 
      observed a significant decrease in Ebola viral load. Her clinical evolution 
      improved with no disturbance in many biological parameters. She was negative for 
      Ebola infection on 13th day and was discharged from the ETU after three weeks of 
      admission. After referral to a health facility an ultrasound revealed 12 weeks of 
      gestation and lab results showed a decrease of 47% in HIV viral load with 44% 
      CD4(+) T cell count increase. She began ART treatment and at 38 weeks gestation, 
      the HIV viral load was undetectable and gave birth by caesarian section to a 
      healthy male newborn. The mother and newborn' s blood, buccal swab and adnexal 
      samples tested negative for Ebola virus and both were discharged 10 days after 
      the delivery. CONCLUSION: In case of Ebola, HIV and malaria co-infection, 
      maternal and fetal survival remains possible even in the context of resources 
      limited-setting. This case raises questions about the effects of the interactions 
      of these co-infections and/or their antibodies, treatment during immune 
      adaptation of the gravid organism.

AB  - Background: Pregnancy induces physiological decline in maternal immunity. Ebola 
      virus disease (EVD) in pregnancy is associated with obstetrical complications, 
      and vaccination in early pregnancy is recommended, but may not be without risk. 
      Case Presentation: We described neonatal survival after spontaneous maternal EVD 
      recovery. This neonate was born to a 25-year-old mother admitted to an Ebola 
      Treatment Unit (ETU) in July, 2020, after 11 days of symptoms. She was vaccinated 
      with rVSV-ZEBOV three days before symptom onset and her real-time polymerase 
      chain of reaction (RT-PCR) results confirmed EVD and malarial infection two days 
      after, but she refused hospitalization. She was treated at home with PO ASAQ, 
      amoxicillin, paracetamol, albendazole, omeprazole, and papaverine. Eleven days 
      later, due to clinical deterioration and onset of vaginal hemorrhage, she finally 
      accepted to be transferred in ETU. She was Parity 2, fetal age at admission was 
      5 weeks and 3 days. Upon admission, her EVD PCR measured NP 26.3 and GP 32.9. She 
      did not receive monoclonal therapy against Ebola infection due to stock shortage. 
      She received intravenous, artesunate, ceftriaxone, and papaverine. She 
      experienced spontaneous resolution of EVD 18 days after symptom onset and was 
      discharged. At 40 weeks gestation, seven and a half months after EVD recovery, 
      she delivered a healthy female infant, APGAR 10/10/10, weighing 3450 g. Maternal 
      blood, adnexal, and newborn blood samples were RT-PCR negative, and the mother 
      and the baby were discharged after 14 days. At our last follow-up, in June 2023 
      (2 years, 3 months after delivery), the mother and the baby were in good health. 
      Conclusion: Neonatal survival following spontaneous maternal recovery from EVD in 
      the first trimester of gestation is rare but possible, even in the context of 
      limited clinical resources for treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Children in febrile coma in Africa are frequently hospitalised, with 
      poorer outcomes than those in high-income settings. Cerebral malaria is 
      historically the most common cause of febrile coma. Due to limited diagnostic and 
      radiological resources and a decrease in malaria prevalence, there might be 
      under-recognition of non-malarial coma. However, prospective data are scarce. We 
      aimed to determine causes, neuroradiological features, risk factors for 
      mortality, and neurosequelae of children in febrile coma in Malawi. METHODS: In 
      this prospective cohort study, we enrolled children in a coma (Blantyre Coma 
      Scale score </=2) who were aged between 3 months and 15 years at Queen Elizabeth 
      Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi. We used pathogen-specific PCR analysis of 
      blood and cerebrospinal fluid for 15 pathogens including Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella spp, 
      non-typhoidal Salmonella, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S Typhi), 
      Klebsiella spp, Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (also using 
      GeneXpert), Streptococcus agalactiae, herpes simplex virus (types 1 and 2), 
      varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, enteroviruses, and SARS-CoV-2; 
      microscopy for malaria; admission brain MRI to enhance the diagnosis of cause and 
      identify brain injury, swelling, and any other complications; and 
      electroencephalography tracings were used identify subclinical seizures or 
      non-convulsive status epilepticus. Assessment of malarial retinopathy was 
      performed by a trained ophthalmologist. We used regression models to estimate 
      risk factors for (and the difference in) 30-day mortality and 180-day 
      neurosequelae (outcome assessed in-person) between children with non-malarial 
      coma and cerebral malaria. FINDINGS: Between Jan 31, 2018, and June 30, 2021, we 
      recruited 352 children with febrile coma. Cerebral malaria was the most common 
      cause (in 231 [66%] of 352 children). Pathogenic diagnosis was possible in 289 
      (82%) of 352 children. Co-infection was identified in 63 (27%) of 231 children 
      with cerebral malaria, of which 49 (78%) were bacterial. The most common 
      non-malarial causes of coma were meningitis (48 [14%] of 352 children) and 
      encephalitis (24 [7%] of 352); 32 (9%) cases had an unknown cause. Compared with 
      standard cultures, PCR significantly increased pathogen diagnosis (p<0.0001), 
      with the highest yield in patients with meningitis (seven [15%] of 48 vs 30 [63%] 
      of 48). S pneumoniae (n=44) and non-typhoidal salmonella or S Typhi (n=24) were 
      the most frequently detected bacterial pathogens. Brain parenchymal abnormalities 
      were identified on MRI in most children with febrile coma (165 [92%] of 178), and 
      were significantly more common in children with non-malarial coma (68 [100%] of 
      68]) than cerebral malaria (98 [89%] of 110; p<0.0001). Overall, at 30 days after 
      discharge, death (69 [21%] of 323) or any neurological impairment (163 [50%] of 
      323) were common, but poorer long-term outcomes were more frequent following 
      non-malarial coma than cerebral malaria (death at 30 days: 32 [28%] of 114 vs 37 
      [18%] of 209, p=0.029; severe neurological impairment at 180 days: 19 [17%] of 
      114 vs 15 [7%] of 209, p=0.0079). Children who had cerebral malaria with CNS 
      co-infection had higher mortality (ten [37%] of 27) than those with cerebral 
      malaria alone (19 [12%] of 154, p=0.0033). INTERPRETATION: Despite malaria 
      control efforts, cerebral malaria remains the most common cause of febrile coma 
      in Malawi. However, non-malarial coma causes a greater disease burden (death and 
      disability), and a higher case-fatality rate was observed in non-malarial coma 
      and cerebral malaria with non-malarial co-infection than cerebral malaria alone. 
      To adequately treat severe invasive bacterial infections, that are frequently not 
      detected in routine clinical practice, commencing empirical antimicrobials in all 
      children in febrile coma, including those with cerebral malaria, could and should 
      be rapidly implemented across Africa and must be considered. The study highlights 
      the value of molecular diagnostics and imaging to guide diagnosis. The frequent 
      findings of brain abnormalities from imaging at admission emphasises the need for 
      earlier escalation of children with febrile coma to specialist care. Further work 
      is needed to develop feasible molecular and radiological diagnostics for their 
      successful deployment across the continent. Implementation of these methods could 
      improve diagnosis and outcomes for children with febrile coma in Africa. FUNDING:

AB  - The wild meat trade poses a significant threat to public health as it facilitates 
      the spillover of zoonotic pathogens through high-risk activities such as the 
      hunting, butchering, trade, and consumption of wild animals. Despite the health 
      risks and association with marking epidemics including SARS, Ebola, and COVID-19, 
      the global wild meat trade continues to thrive. To summarize the evidence 
      available, primary literature published between 2000 and 2022 was systematically 
      and critically assessed for evidence of zoonotic pathogens or other infectious 
      organisms detected in samples directly from wild meat, from animals hunted for 
      wild meat, or from humans exposed through high-risk activities. Within the 97 
      articles analyzed, a total of 114 pathogen genera (15 viruses, 40 bacteria, 54 
      parasites, and 5 fungi) were detected in wild meat animals belonging to 168 
      vertebrate species including mammals, reptiles and birds sampled in 32 countries. 
      In the context of wild meat specifically, infectious organisms were 
      differentiated between those with zoonotic potential (32% of reported genera), 
      ectoparasitic vectors (1%), and possible opportunistic or environmental 
      contaminants. Thirteen viral, four bacterial, and one parasitic genera were also 
      documented in humans participating in wild meat trade activities, supporting 
      pathogen spillover potential. Most studies employed a targeted approach to 
      evaluate the presence of (i.e., polymerase chain reaction (PCR); n = 65) or 
      exposure to (i.e., ELISA; n = 19) a specific pathogen, while only one study 
      employed broad-spectrum metabarcoding techniques. The diversity of infectious 
      organisms associated with wild meat are highlighted through this review and could 
      be used to guide policy development. However, the common use of a selected set of 
      targeted detection assays likely biases the exploration of pathogen diversity, 
      therefore potentially preventing the discovery of "disease x". The global health 
      risk demonstrated should make the illegal wild meat trade a priority for 
      law-enforcement agencies and future research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Filoviruses, including Ebola and Marburg viruses, cause severe 
      hemorrhagic fever in humans and primates. These viruses pose significant threats 
      to public health, making rapid and sensitive detection critical for controlling 
      outbreaks. We developed and validated a hemi-nested generic PanFilo assay to 
      detect all Ebola virus species, Marburg viruses, and recently discovered bat 
      filoviruses. This assay was deployed to 15 European laboratories and evaluated 
      through testing of eight non-infectious samples. OBJECTIVES: Laboratories were 
      asked to determine the detection limit of positive controls and test all samples 
      using the assay provided. The deployed assay enables direct Nanopore sequencing 
      of PCR products, by using tagged primers during the second round of PCR. 
      Sequencing of the samples was carried out on a voluntary basis. RESULTS: 
      Multicenter validation revealed a 95 % limit of detection of 5309 RNA copies/microL 
      for Ebola, 10,273 copies/microL for Marburg, and 2145 copies/microL for Mengla virus. In 
      an implementation quality assessment, 93.3 % (84/90) of samples containing 
      filovirus RNA were correctly identified and 100 % (30/30) of filovirus-negative 
      samples were correctly identified. Thirteen laboratories sequenced PCR products, 
      with nine identifying all positive samples correctly. CONCLUSION: The assay 
      enables rapid and reliable detection of filoviruses, with sequencing capabilities 
      for identifying both known and novel variants. This assay might be used for 
      detection during the initial phase of an emerging filovirus outbreak, before a 
      specific assay has been developed. However, our distribution across 15 
      laboratories revealed variability challenges due to reagents, human performance, 
      and sequencing capacity, emphasizing the need for more training and 
      standardization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The recent global spread of highly pathogenic viruses, such as Mpox 
      and Ebola viruses, highlights the urgent need for multiplex detection 
      technologies. Current methods lack the capability for simultaneous 
      identification, which hampers outbreak control in resource-limited settings and 
      global surveillance efforts. Traditional techniques, like real-time quantitative 
      polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), are often impractical in resource-limited areas 
      due to laboratory dependency, and specialized personnel requirements. A portable, 
      rapid, and cost-effective method for multiplex field detection of highly 
      pathogenic viruses is critically needed to address the growing threat of 
      outbreaks in resource-limited settings. RESULTS: In this study, a simple and 
      rapid nucleic acid extraction method was performed using a paper-based dipstick, 
      which was equipment-free and could be completed within 2 min. Subsequently, a 
      microfluidic chip was integrated with loop-mediated isothermal amplification 
      (LAMP) technology to develop a field-deployable, portable detection method termed 
      the microfluidic-LAMP assay. This assay allows for the simultaneous detection of 
      eight highly pathogenic viruses: Ebola virus (EBOV), Marburg virus (MARV), Rift 
      Valley fever virus (RVFV), Lassa virus (LASV), yellow fever virus (YFV), Congo 
      Basin Mpox virus (C-MPXV), West African Mpox virus (W-MPXV), and variola virus 
      (VARV), all within a span of 70 min. The assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 
      7.02 x 10(2)-8 x 10(4) copies/mL across different targets using simulated 
      clinical samples. The limits of detection of this field available assay were 
      comparable to or lower than those of the real-time quantitative PCR. The 
      microfluidic-LAMP assay demonstrated good specificity in cross-tests with 21 
      pathogens, including the above 8 viruses and 13 other respiratory pathogens. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: This study presents the first portable microfluidic-LAMP assay 
      capable of simultaneously detecting eight highly pathogenic viruses in 
      resource-limited settings. The assay's equipment-free nucleic acid extraction 
      (2 min) and rapid detection (70 min) make it a practical solution for on-site 
      detection in resource-limited regions, facilitating outbreak control and global 
      surveillance efforts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: On January 30, 2025, the Uganda Ministry of Health declared an 
      outbreak of Sudan virus disease (SVD) following laboratory confirmation from 
      postmortem samples of a suspected case identified through routine mortality 
      surveillance for viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) at Mulago National Referral 
      Hospital, Kampala. This report describes the laboratory procedures used to 
      confirm the 2025 SVD index case, emphasizing the vital role of rapid diagnostics 
      in containing VHFs. METHODS: We leveraged existing surveillance infrastructure to 
      collect, package, transport, test, and report results for the index-confirmed 
      case. Testing was conducted within the framework of the established laboratory 
      quality and bio-risk management system at the Central Emergency Response and 
      Surveillance Laboratory. The workflow consisted of sample delivery, reception, 
      preparation, nucleic acid extraction, master mix preparation, quantitative 
      reverse transcriptase polymerase chain Reaction (RT-qPCR), differential diagnosis 
      for VHFs, parallel PCR testing and typing for Sudan virus (SUDV) confirmation, 
      result validation, and reporting. RESULTS: The sample tested negative for 
      Marburg, Yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, and Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever 
      viruses. However, it tested positive for SUDV. Four parallel tests utilizing the 
      Real Star(R) Filovirus Screen RT-PCR Kit 1.0 (Altona Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, 
      Germany) on CFX96 Bio-Rad platforms, with varying sample volumes (140 microL, 90 microL, 
      50 microL, and 30 microL diluted with nuclease-free water), confirmed the presence of 
      SUDV. The 50 microL sample had the lowest Ct values for the Orthoebolavirus target, 
      while the 30 microL sample had the lowest Ct values for the internal control target. 
      The turnaround time, from sample reception to results reporting to the Ministry 
      of Health leadership, was less than 12 h. CONCLUSION: Mortality surveillance of 
      VHFs is vital for the swift identification of Filovirus outbreaks in high-risk 
      areas. Comprehensive VHFs panel testing is crucial for detecting pathogens in 
      suspected cases. Sample dilution impacts diagnostic sensitivity, making optimized 
      testing protocols crucial for precise molecular diagnostics. A rapid turnaround 
      time is critical to outbreaks, enabling timely public health decisions such as 
      case isolation, contact tracing, and resource allocation.

AB  - Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) remains a significant public health threat, 
      particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. During the 10th Ebola outbreak in the 
      Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the Pamoja Tulinde Maisha clinical trial 
      (PALM-RCT) provided a unique opportunity to evaluate new therapeutic 
      interventions. Despite these advances, limited knowledge exists regarding the 
      dynamic evolution of mortality risk factors in EVD patients. This study aimed to 
      model risk factors associated with mortality using logistic regression on 
      unbalanced panel data from patients enrolled in this trial.We conducted a 
      retrospective secondary analysis of longitudinal data from 617 EVD patients 
      included in the PALM-RCT. Data were collected at five time points: Day0 
      (admission), Day7, Day14, Day21, and Day28. A binary logistic regression model 
      was applied at each time point to identify significant predictors of mortality. 
      The Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to assess model calibration and internal 
      validation. At Day0 (admission), six significant predictors of mortality were 
      identified: viral load (RT-PCR cycle threshold value), creatinine, alanine 
      aminotransferase (ALAT), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), haemorrhage, 
      shortness of breath, and conjunctivitis. By Day7, five predictors emerged: 
      sodium, ASAT, coma, abdominal pain, and shortness of breath. At Day14, two 
      predictors remained significant: ASAT and mental state changes. No significant 
      predictors were identified at Day21 and Day28. The dynamic nature of these risk 
      factors highlights the importance of continuous monitoring throughout the 
      clinical course of EVD.Our study demonstrates that mortality risk factors in EVD 
      patients evolve over time, suggesting that a dynamic approach to patient 
      monitoring is critical. Early risk factors such as viral load and renal function 
      should guide initial interventions, while neurological symptoms and electrolyte 
      imbalances require attention in later stages. These findings support a 
      personalized approach to EVD management, where clinical care is adjusted based on 
      real-time clinical data to improve patient outcomes.

TI  - Long-term clinical sequelae among Sudan ebolavirus disease survivors 2 years 
      post-infection: a matched cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The long-term health effects of ebolavirus disease (EVD) caused by 
      the Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV) strain remain poorly characterized. Here, we assessed 
      the nature, frequency, and persistence of post-EVD clinical symptoms among SUDV 
      survivors 2 years after infection by comparing them with matched community 
      controls. METHODS: The primary objective was determining the prevalence of 
      clinical symptoms over the 24-month period. Using a prospective matched cohort 
      approach, 87 laboratory-confirmed SUDV survivors from the 2022-2023 Ugandan 
      outbreak and 176 age-, sex- and village-matched controls were followed at 3, 9, 
      12, 15 and 24 months. Symptom data were collected through structured interviews 
      and targeted clinical examinations. A secondary objective was investigating the 
      duration of viral RNA shedding in semen and breast milk of survivors collected 
      during follow-up, using the PCR test. RESULTS: Of the 87 SUDV survivors, 57.5% 
      reported significantly higher frequencies of clinical symptoms involving 
      musculoskeletal (45.0%, P < 0.001), central nervous system (36.3%, p < 0.001), 
      ophthalmologic (20%, P < 0.001), and respiratory (10%, P < 0.001) systems than 
      those observed among controls. The risk ratio of occurrence was highest for 
      ophthalmologic (20% vs 3.4%, RR = 5.9; p < 0.001) and central nervous systems 
      symptoms (36.3% vs 6.8%, RR = 5.3, p < 0.001), and lowest for reproductive system 
      (13.8% vs 8.5%; RR = 1.6; p > 0.005). Importantly, 50% of the survivors reported 
      persistent multi-systemic symptoms, including low back pain, hand and feet 
      numbness, confusion, and diarrhoea that resulted in an inability to perform basic 
      activities of living. Viral RNA was detected in semen for up to 210 
      post-infection (median = 131 days, range: 111-210 days) and in breast milk for up 
      to 199 days (median = 149 days, range: 111-199 days). CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      demonstrates that SUDV survivors develop long-term clinical sequelae 
      characterized by persistent multi-systemic clinical symptoms. Detection of viral 
      RNA in semen and breastmilk for up to 7 months post-infection suggests prolonged 
      persistence, opening the possibility of latency and reactivation of the virus.

AB  - The rapid and accurate detection of highly pathogenic viruses is critical for 
      public health, especially in the context of potential bioterrorism threats. This 
      study presents a novel multiplex probe amplification (MPA) assay combined with 
      melting curve analysis for the simultaneous detection of nine high-threat viral 
      agents: Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Rift 
      Valley fever virus, Chikungunya virus, Monkeypox virus, Eastern equine 
      encephalitis virus, Tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Venezuelan equine 
      encephalitis virus. The MPA-nine-viruses assay utilizes three fluorescence 
      channels and unique melting temperatures to differentiate between targets, 
      achieving high sensitivity with a limit of detection as low as 1.5-15 copies/muL. 
      The MPA-nine-viruses was highly specific and distinguished mixed targets 
      accurately, even for the nine viruses' mixture. The assay was validated using 392 
      simulated samples (including serum, swabs, mosquito vectors, and soil samples) 
      and 22 clinical samples, demonstrating 100% accuracy. The MPA-nine-viruses assay 
      offers a cost-effective, high-throughput solution for large-scale screening and 
      is poised to play a crucial role in the prevention and control of outbreaks and 
      bioterrorism events involving these pathogens. IMPORTANCE: Ebola virus, Lassa 
      virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus, 
      Chikungunya virus, Monkeypox virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, Tick-borne 
      encephalitis virus, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus can cause severe 
      infections and diseases, such as hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, meningitis, and 
      chikungunya fever. These viruses pose significant threats to public health due to 
      their high infectivity and mortality rates, and they could potentially be used as 
      bioterrorism agents. Early detection is the most critical step for effective 
      prevention and control of infection. However, there is no sensitive nucleic acid 
      detection method for the nine high-threat viral agents tested simultaneously. In 
      this study, we developed multiplex probe amplification (MPA) with Melting Curve 
      PCR method, named MPA-nine-viruses, which overcame the limitation of the 
      available fluorescence channel number and realized simultaneous detection of nine 
      high-threat viral agents in a single reaction, with high sensitivity and 
      specificity for the targets.

TI  - Evaluating the impact of trade-offs in diagnostic test accuracy, 
      time-to-isolation, and accessibility on outbreak response for the Ebola virus: a 
      mathematical modeling study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ebolavirus and related filoviruses are feared pathogens due to high 
      mortality rates, and cases are confirmed using reverse transcription-polymerase 
      chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Compared to rapid diagnostic testing (RDT), 
      RT-PCR has higher accuracy but longer turnaround time and lower testing rate. 
      RDTs' accuracy for Ebola does not meet the World Health Organization's (WHO) 
      target product profile (TPP). This TPP, however, excludes trade-offs between 
      accuracy, time-to-isolation (the time from getting tested to getting hospitalized 
      and isolated), and accessibility. This research aims to guide diagnostic test 
      development and use by identifying trade-offs in accuracy, time-to-isolation, and 
      accessibility that enable impactful outbreak response. METHODS: A mathematical 
      compartmental model was calibrated to the 2014-2016 Sierra Leone EBOV epidemic, 
      including test accuracy, accessibility, and time-to-isolation parameters. These 
      parameters were varied to evaluate their impact on total epidemic size in 
      different in isolation and in combination. RESULTS: Reductions in EBOV test 
      sensitivity or specificity alone will increase the expected number of cases from 
      11.7 to 223%, while any decrease in time-to-isolation alone (due to a more rapid 
      test result) or increase in testing rate alone would decrease the expected number 
      of cases by 47.7-87.7%. When combining the three factors together, the benefits 
      associated with an RDT would outweigh the harms, with a combined net reduction of 
      mean cases between 71.6 and 92.3%. CONCLUSIONS: When coupled with a more rapid 
      turnaround time and increase in test access, the use of a lower performance test 
      can result in significantly reduced epidemic size compared to relying on PCR 
      alone in an EBOV outbreak in a resource-limited setting.
